The majority of statements from the 2012 guidelinehave been updated based on current knowledge and practice.Only 6 statements were retained in their original form in 2012. There is clear and increasing recognition of CKD as a global public health problem. The inclusion of people with CKD in clinical trials has improved substantially, thus generat

There are increasing efforts toimprove diagnostic evaluation of cause, with increased so-phistication of imaging methods, biopsy interrogation, andgenetic evaluation, as well as methods to optimize blood andurine testing. With advances in technology, such as moleculardiagnostics for tissue samples, integrated omics platforms, and the use of machine l
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	tegrated omics platforms, and the use of machine learning/arti ﬁcial intelligence to explore large databases of both clinical and biological data,we are truly at the beginning of a new era in nephrology. This guideline integrates existing and new knowledge to guide the care of people with CKD. It has been developed byan international Work Group that included patient partners,clinicians, and researchers with diverse experience across thespectrum of populations, a dedicated Evidence Review Team, a
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	f populations, a dedicated Evidence Review Team, and professional KDIGO staff. This clinical practice guideline includes 2 different types of statements: graded recommen-dations, which are supported by systematic reviews (i.e., de novo reviews conducted by the independent Evidence Review Team or existing high-quality reviews that have been sys-tematically identi ﬁed), and ungraded practice points, which serve to direct clinical care or activities for which a systematicreview was not conducted fo
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	for which a systematicreview was not conducted for various reasons (e.g., lack of a sufﬁcient evidence base or randomized controlled trials that would be impractical/unethical). Both recommendations andpractice points are intended to help guide clinical practice andaid in decision-making; thus, collectively are the guidelinestatements. They are clearly articulated, actionable, and pre-sented together so that all guideline statements can beimplemented. The distinction between them is based on th

The distinction between them is based on theprocess by which they are derived, and that process is basedon the framework methodology from the KDIGO Methods Committee and aligns with other international guidelinegroups using the “Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation ”(GRADE) methodology. New developments in the re ﬁnement of evaluation of glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), population and individual risk prediction, and novel treatments have all positively in ﬂue

TheWork Group has aimed to generate a guideline that is bothrigorously devoted to new and existing evidence, and that isclinically useful. Research recommendations are presented in aseparate section of the document and are intended to guide the next set of important research questions to inform and improve the outcomes of people living with CKD. We speci ﬁcally urge the community to b

We speci ﬁcally urge the community to be inclusive of people across the lifecycle andinclude sex (referring to biological factors including genetics,sex steroids, physiology, and anatomy), gender (referring tosociocultural factors such as identity, roles, and relations), andetiology of CKD as important variables in all studies. We offer recommendations to clinicians and clinical labo- ratories to understand and promote the standardization and accuracy of testing tools including assays
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	ion and accuracy of testing tools including assays and equipment. Theeffective use of clinical practice guidelines and, therefore,effective patient care, including accurate diagnosis and referralprioritization, clinical research, and public health prioritiza-tion, requires comparability of laboratory results independentof time, place, and measurement procedure. Key to this isestablishing precision of testing and between-laboratory agreement with traceability to accepted international refer- ence
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	traceability to accepted international refer- ence standards wherever available. Therefore, this guidancedocument includes standards for laboratory tests. Speci ﬁcally, we focus on creatinine and cystatin C, with the goal ofnormalizing access to both tests for increased accuracy of GFRassessment, and the assessment of urine albumin which is alsocritical to risk assessment and care plans. The guideline is organized into 6 chapters ( Tables 1 ,4,a n d 5 cover Chapters 1 –5). In this summary, we ou

We begin with acknowledgment that the de ﬁnition and classi ﬁcation system is widely accepted by the community. Speci ﬁcally, we remind readers of the difference between the de ﬁnition of CKD, which is inclusive of various markers of kidney damage, and the classi- ﬁcation system that highlights the importance of the CGA sys- tem (i.e., Cause/Glomerular ﬁltration ra

We highlight the difference between relative and absolute risks (the latter derived by applying individual risk prediction scores),acknowledge that there are different risks for different pop-ulations, and do not support any age-adjusted de ﬁnitions of CKD, as there are no age-adjusted de ﬁnitions for diabetes

Screening. Despite the increasing recognition of the true burden of CKD, there remains controversy and lack of consensusas to the utility of population screening for CKD 1or targeted screening programs2due to the complexity of the underlying sociopolitical and resource environment. Public

Public health policyhas a role to play in identifying and addressing risk factors toprevent CKD, to identify CKD early, and to delay its progressionand associated adverse outcomes. Incorporating evidence-based treatment of people with CKD with sodium-glucose cotrans- porter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, together with a systematic reviewin people with diabetes and hypertension, suggests thatscreening adults for CKD could now be cost-effective. 3,4 International

In low- and middle-income countries and in the lower sociodemographic quintilesaround the world, there is a large gap between CKD burden andprovision of adequate healthcare. There is limited access to kidney replacement therapy combined with the rising preva- lence of diabetes and hypertension and evidence of substantialsex and gender disparities in access to CKD treatment.Importantly, slowing CKD progression at early stages shou

A systematicreview of care models in low- and middle-income countriesfound that those supporting primary care providers or allied health workers achieved effectiveness in slowing GFR decline, as opposed to interventions centered on specialty care alone. 5 Where there are resource limitations, it is logical to deploy re-sources where they wi

Special considerations and updated population data. We recognize that kidney diseases affect people at different timesand with different impacts across the whole lifespan. Thus, enabling a personalized approach, considering age, sex, and gender for diagnosis, risk assessment, and treatment, is critical.At the extremes of age, the very young and the very old, diag-nostic pr

In young and middle-agedadults, treatment approaches may differ because of speci ﬁc circumstances, such as pregnancy or menopause.

Evaluation of CKD 1.1 Detection and evaluation of CKD 1.1.1 Detection of CKD Practice Point 1.1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin measurement and assessment of glomerul ar ﬁltration rate (GFR). Practice Point 1.1.1.2: Following incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), hematuria, or low estimated GFR (e GFR), repeat tests to con ﬁrm presence of CKD. 1.1.2 Methods
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	t tests to con ﬁrm presence of CKD. 1.1.2 Methods for staging of CKD Recommendation 1.1.2.1: In adults at risk for CKD, we recommend using creatinine-based estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFRcr). If cystatin C is available, the GFR category should be estimated from the combination of creatinine and cystatin C (creatinine and cystatin C – based estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate [eGFRcr-cys]) ( 1B). 1.1.3 Evaluation of chronicity Practice Point 1.1.3.1: Proof of chronicity (duration of a m
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	oint 1.1.3.1: Proof of chronicity (duration of a minimum of 3 months) can be established by: (i) review of past measurements/estimations of GFR;(ii) review of past measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria and urine microscopic examinations; (iii) imaging ﬁndings such as reduced kidney size and reduction in cortical thickness; (iv) kidney pathological ﬁndings such as ﬁbrosis and atrophy; (v) medical history, especially conditions known to cause or contribute to CKD; (vi) repeat measurements wit
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	or contribute to CKD; (vi) repeat measurements within and beyond the 3-month point. Practice Point 1.1.3.2: Do not assume chronicity based upon a single abnormal level for eGFR and ACR, as the ﬁnding could be the result of a recent acute kidney injury (AKI) event or acute kidney disease (AKD). Practice Point 1.1.3.3: Consider initiation of treatments for CKD at ﬁrst presentation of decreased GFR or elevated ACR if CKD is deemed likely due to presence of other clinical indicators. 1.1.4 Evaluatio
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	ence of other clinical indicators. 1.1.4 Evaluation of cause Practice Point 1.1.4.1: Establish the cause of CKD using clinical context, personal and family history, social and environmental factors, medicati ons, physical examination, laboratory measures, imaging, and genetic and pathologic diagnosis (Figure 8 a). Practice Point 1.1.4.2: Use tests to establish a cause based on resources available (Table 6b). Recommendation 1.1.4.1: We suggest performing a kidney biopsy as an acceptable, safe, di
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	forming a kidney biopsy as an acceptable, safe, diagnostic test to evaluate cause and guide treatment decisions when clinically appropriate ( 2D). 1.2 Evaluation of GFR 1.2.1 Other functions of kidneys besides GFR Practice Point 1.2.1.1: Use the term “GFR ”when referring to the speci ﬁc kidney function of glomerular ﬁltration. Use the more general term “kidney function(s) ”when dealing with the totality of functions of the kidney. 1.2.2 Guidance to physicians and other healthcare providers Pract
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	to physicians and other healthcare providers Practice Point 1.2.2.1: Use serum creatinine (SCr) and an estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR (Figure 11c). Recommendation 1.2.2.1: We recommend using eGFRcr-cys in clinical situations when eGFRcr is less accurate and GFR affects clinical decision-making (Table 8d)(1C). Practice Point 1.2.2.2: Where more accurate ascertainment of GFR will impact treatment decisions, measure GFR using plasma or urinary clearance of a n exogenous ﬁltration
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	ma or urinary clearance of a n exogenous ﬁltration marker (Table 9e). Practice Point 1.2.2.3: Understand the value and limitations in both eGFR and measured glomerular ﬁltration rate (mGFR) as well as the variability and factors that in ﬂuence SCr and cystatin C measurements. Practice Point 1.2.2.4: Interpretation of SCr level requires consideration of dietary intake.Practice Point 1.2.2.5: Assess the potential for error in eGFR when assessing a change in GFR over time.Practice Point 1.2.2.6: Co
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	change in GFR over time.Practice Point 1.2.2.6: Consider the use of cystatin C –based estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFRcys) in some speci ﬁc circumstances. Practice Point 1.2.2.7: Understand the implications of differences between eGFRcr and eGFRcys, as these may be informative, in both direction and magnitude of those differences. Practice Point 1.2.2.8: Consider timed urine collections for measured creatinine clearance if mGFR is not available and eGFRcr-cys is thought to be inaccurate

Practice Point 1.2.3.2: Given available resources, clinical laboratories may consider the possibility of measurement of both creatinine and cysta tin either as an in-house test or as a referred test. Special considerations Pediatric

Chapter 1: Evaluation of CKD This chapter highlights the importance of detecting CKDin high-risk populations because CKD is often silent andpatients may be asymptomatic at early stages. Thescreening algorithm for the diagnosis of CKD in adultshighlights the use of basic testing methods, and then details the importance of thorough evaluation for the cause and accurate

There are special considerations in pediatricpopulations and those with advanced age regardingscreening and staging. The evaluation of cause should bethorough, using all available information (clinical, social,and family history) and accessible testing (laboratory, imaging, genetics, and biopsy), given that etiology impacts prognosis, risk, and ch
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	iven that etiology impacts prognosis, risk, and choice of therapies. Given that up to25% of all current CKD registries or study cohorts have“unknown etiology ”documented, there is renewed interestin enabling clinicians and people with CKD to under- stand, if possible, the cause of CKD. The chapter also reminds clinicians that the kidney has many functions (excretory, endocrine, and metabolic) andthat GFR is one component of excretory function. Under-standing the best methods by which to evaluate
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	der-standing the best methods by which to evaluate GFR andwhen to use estimating equations versus direct measurementsis highlighted. The recommendations to use the most accurate, validated equations to estimate GFR, preferably with a combination ofserum creatinine and cystatin C, are important. From both apatient and provider perspective, acknowledging that serumcreatinine –based equations have limitations that can be overcome with the use of an additional marker (cystatin C) isnotable and place

The chapter describes the value of using a com- bined creatinine and cystatin C –based equation in speci ﬁc situations. Table 2 highlights clinical circumstances where this might apply. 7–23As we acquire more knowledge and data about GFR estimating equations using cystatin C versuscreatinine or both, there are now recognized implications of
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	or both, there are now recognized implications ofthose differences that need to be understood by clinicians, inboth direction and magnitude. There are issues related to how best to estimate GFR in transgender, gender-diverse, or nonbinary individuals where aTable 1 | (Continued) Chapter 2.

The calcu- lation of estimated GFR by creatinine and cystatin C usingeither sex constant may be impacted by non-GFR de-terminants of creatinine, and a holistic approach should be taken to determine appropriate management anchored to the muscle mass of
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	opriate management anchored to the muscle mass of the individual and based on their sex hor-mone con ﬁguration and gender identity. Similarly, cystatin C–based equations may be affected by gender hormone – afﬁrming therapy. The assessment of gender in the context of eGFR is therefore an area for shared decision-making andan evolving area for investigation. Where more accurate ascertainment of GFR will impact treatment decisions (e.g., oncology drug dosing, kidney donor eligibility, etc.), clinic
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	ug dosing, kidney donor eligibility, etc.), clinicians are encouraged to measure GFR byestablished clearance methods of glomerular ﬁltration markers (Table 3 ). The chapter addresses and reinforces key points for clinical laboratories including the implementation of laboratorystandards for reporting, the use of enzymatic assays instead ofJaffe method for creatinine measurements (given the inter- ference of many drugs and substances when using the latter), timing of processing of blood samples, a
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	latter), timing of processing of blood samples, and simultaneousmeasurement of creatinine and cystatin C on the same bloodsample. These are all intended to improve consistency andcomparability of laboratory values. The chapter also recommends using validated GFR esti- mating equations that should be the same within geographicalregions so that people with CKD and healthcare providers (HCPs) have access to the same information, derived using the same methodology. The evaluation of albuminuria is
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	ame methodology. The evaluation of albuminuria is also addressed in this chapter, so that clinicians are aware and understand the de-terminants of albuminuria measurements, which will enablebetter interpretation and guide action. Given the established,consistent strong relationship between the quantity of urinealbumin with both kidney disease and CVD risk, clinicians are encouraged to pay attention to this measurement. Albu- minuria measurements may not be available in all regions,and proteinuri
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	may not be available in all regions,and proteinuria is not the same as albuminuria; clinicians should appreciate those differences. There are factors thatinﬂuence variability in urine albumin or protein measures, as there are different ones that impact urine creatinine. Given that the ratios are used to ascertain risk, understanding sources of both analytical and biological variability isimportant for the interpretation of ﬂuctuations in urine ACR. The use of point-of-care testing may facilitate

The value of point-of-care testing forcurrently underserved populations cannot be overstated andshould include the capacity for generating creatinine-based eGFR equations. The point-of-care testing devices used would ideally measure both blood creatinine and urine foralbumin and creatinine to measure ACR and be standardizedand calibrated with similar rigor

Overall, this chapter presents statements that help HCPs to fully evaluate people with the diagnosis of CKD and providesdata to aid the clinicians and the laboratories to understand and appreciate nuances of evaluating the common tests for assessing GFR and albuminuria, and aims to aid in increasingaccuracy of risk assessments to guide therapeutic decision-making.

Recommendation 3.6.3: We recommend starting RASi (ACEi or ARB ) for people with CKD and moderately-to-severely increased albuminuria (G1 –G4, A2 and A3) with diabetes (1B). Recommendation 3.6.4: We recommend avoiding any combination of ACEi, ARB, and direct renin inhibitor (DRI) therapy in people with CKD, with or without diabetes (1B). Practice Point 3.6.1: RASi (ACEi or ARB) should b e administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	using the highest approved dose that is tolerated to achieve the bene ﬁts described because the proven bene ﬁts were achieved in trials using these doses. Practice Point 3.6.2: Changes in BP, serum creatinin e, and serum potassium sh ould be checked within 2 –4 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending on the current GFR and serum potassium. Practice Point 3.6.3: Hyperkalemia a ssociated with use of RASi can often be managed by me asures to reduce the serum potassium level
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	d by me asures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Practice Point 3.6.4: Continue ACEi or AR B therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30 % within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Practice Point 3.6.5: Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treatin
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	atment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate [eGFR] <15 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Practice Point 3.6.6: Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albu minuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or ARB) for speci ﬁc indications (e.g., to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). Practice Point 3.6.7: Continue ACEi or ARB in people wit h CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2. 3.7 Sodium-glucose
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	s below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2. 3.7 Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) Recommendation 3.7.1: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m2with an SGLT2i (1A) . Practice Point 3.7.1: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reason able to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2,u n l e s si t is not tolerated or KRT is initiated. Practice Point 3.7.2: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of pro
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of pro longed fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis). Recommendation 3.7.2: We recommend treating ad ults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A) : /C15eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m2with urine ACR ‡200 mg/g ( ‡20 mg/mmol), or /C15heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria. Practice Point 3.7.3: SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	tate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy. Recommendation 3.7.3: We suggest treating adults with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2with urine ACR <200 mg/g ( <20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i (2B). 3.8 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) Recommendation 3.8.1: We suggest a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with proven kidney or cardiovascular bene ﬁt for adults with T2D,
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	ey or cardiovascular bene ﬁt for adults with T2D, an eGFR >25 ml/min per 1.73 m2,normal serum potassium concentration, and albuminuria ( >30 mg/g [ >3 mg/mmol]) despite maximum tolerated dose of RAS inhibitor (RASi) (2A). Practice Point 3.8.1: Nonsteroidal MRA are most appropriate for adults with T2D who are at high risk of CKD progression and cardiovascular events, as demonstrated by persistent albuminuria despite other standard-of-care therapies. Practice Point 3.8.2: A nonsteroidal MRA may be
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	s. Practice Point 3.8.2: A nonsteroidal MRA may be added to a RASi and an SGLT2i for treatment of T2D and CKD in adults.Practice Point 3.8.3: To mitigate risk of hyperkalemia, select people with consistently normal serum potassium concentration and monitor serum potassium regularly after initiation of a nonsteroidal MRA (Figure 26 b). Practice Point 3.8.4: The choice of a nonsteroidal MRA should prioritize agents with documented kidney or cardiovascular bene ﬁts. Practice Point 3.8.5: A steroida

There is an abundance of literature on which to base guidance on the use of SGLT2 inhibitors to both delay CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular complications. Nu-ances for those with and without diabetes, heart failure, andfor those with higher and lower urine ACR levels are clearlyarticulated. Guidance for the use of mineralocorticoid an-tagonists (both steroidal and nonsteroidal) is also offered,given their value in blood pressure managem

The treatment of metabolic acidosis to delay progression of CKD has not been proven; however, it is recognized thatacidosis can lead to exacerbation of nutritional issues(anorexia and protein wasting), bone disease, and other consequences. These can be addressed with both dietary in- terventions and medications. Suggestions to evaluate the risk-beneﬁt

Practice Point 3.15.2.1: Consider other antiplatelet therapy (e.g., P2Y 12inhibitors) when there is aspirin intolerance. 3.15.3 Invasive versus intensive medical therapy for coronary artery disease Recommendation 3.15.
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	y for coronary artery disease Recommendation 3.15.3.1: We suggest that in stable stress-test con ﬁrmed ischemic heart disease, an initial conservative approach using intensive medical therapy is an appropriate alternative to an initial invasive strategy ( 2D). Practice Point 3.15.3.1: Initial management with an invasive strategy may still be preferable for people with CKD with acute or unstable coronary dis ease, unacceptable levels of angina (e.g., patient dissatisfaction), left ventricular sys

The use of statins, antiplatelet therapy, and invasive versus intensive medical therapy is addressed in detail, citingand interpreting an extensive evidence base. The chapter emphasizes the need to evaluate people with CKD comprehensively in order to address both progressive
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	prehensively in order to address both progressive CKD and its attendant comorbidities in an integrated mannerand draws on literature to support this holistic approach(Figure 2 24). Chapter 4: Medical management and drug stewardship in CKD This chapter reminds HCPs and people with CKD about the importance of assessing medications in the context of GFR,and given that GFR changes over time, it emphasizes the needfor and value of regular reassessment ( Table 5 ). Drugs with narrow therapeutic window
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	( Table 5 ). Drugs with narrow therapeutic windows need to be dosed according to the most accurate assessment of GFR, which may requiredirect measurement. Understanding of drug metabolism and excretion is poor in speci ﬁc patient groups (children and in persons of child- bearing age), and the impact of concomitant hormonaltherapy (for any reason, in male or female individuals) is notknown. Thus, we should proceed with caution and ensure that we gather more data in these areas to better inform c
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	gather more data in these areas to better inform care for diverse individuals across the life spectrum. Chapter 4 also promotes the concepts of recognizing the risks of polypharmacy, the potential value of deprescribing,and the need for good drug stewardship, both for peoplewith CKD as well as providers. Accessible education andcommunication for people with CKD will support efforts athealth literacy but also potentially mitigate issues of non- adherence. Given the very large number of drugs that
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	herence. Given the very large number of drugs that peoplewith CKD are prescribed, this is an important component of care, ensuring that people are prescribed the right drugs forthe right reasons at the right dose. Lastly, the chapter highlights new literature that suggests that intravenous contrast does not carry large risks in people with CKD and that imaging studies should be performedbased on information they provide and how and if they willchange management. The true low risk of associated a

The true low risk of associated acutekidney injury is highlighted and will require ongoing edu-cation of all HCPs and people with CKD to enable appro-priate timely diagnostic imaging. Chapter 5: Optimal models of care This chapter addresses the value of referral to nephrologyspecialists for comprehensive evaluation and work-up and the importance of access to multidisciplinary care teams, while recognizing the associated cost(s) and the nonavail-ability of multidisciplinary care
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Executive-Summary.pdf	nd the nonavail-ability of multidisciplinary care teams in different regions(Table 5 ). There is an emphasis on standardized regular assessment of symptoms, and the use of validated ques-tionnaires to help both people with CKD and HCPsappreciate changes over time and the impact of symptommanagement ( Figure 3 ). The need for planned and extended transitions from pe- diatric to adult care is highlighted, as is the importance of trueteam-based care models. The value of supportive care andcomprehen

Usually, damage is assessed  by the urine albumin (ACR) and function by GFR, but there are also other  markers of kidney damage (Figure 1).  CKD is categorized based on 2 dimension
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Top-10-Takeaways-for-PCPs-Evaluation.pdf	igure 1).  CKD is categorized based on 2 dimensions (i.e., GFR and ACR), however,  CKD is classi/f_ied based on Cause, GFR category (G1–G5), and Albuminuria  category (A1–A3).  In patients who have recovered from AKI, the diagnosis of CKD should  wait for 3 months after discharge. The threshold for CKD should be GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 in older adults,  even if they do not have signi/f_icant albuminuria (ACR <30 mg/g). Epidemi- ologic data demonstrate that there are higher risks for myriad advers
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Top-10-Takeaways-for-PCPs-Evaluation.pdf	rate that there are higher risks for myriad adverse  outcomes below a GFR <60 (Figure 2). Estimating GFR from a combination of creatinine and cystatin C  (eGFRcr-cys) improves accuracy and strengthens risk relationships. When  you are uncertain about creatinine, obtain eGFRcr-cys or eGFRcys in your  patients. Both eGFR and urinary albumin have random /f_luctuations that can cause  changes that have no clinical importance. However, changes in eGFR  beyond ±20% are likely to be caused by actual ch
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Top-10-Takeaways-for-PCPs-Evaluation.pdf	beyond ±20% are likely to be caused by actual changes in kidney  function. For urine albumin, reductions beyond 50% or elevations  beyond 100% are probably beyond the random /f_luctuations. Use a validated GFR estimating equation to derive GFR (eGFR) from the  serum /f_iltration markers, creatinine and/or cystatin C. Different equations  may be required for adults and children. Your patient’s risk of kidney failure can be calculated from validated  equations that incorporate eGFR and urine alb
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Top-10-Takeaways-for-PCPs-Evaluation.pdf	ted  equations that incorporate eGFR and urine albumin, such as the kidney  failure risk equation (kidneyfailurerisk.com). Estimation of kidney failure  risk can be used to facilitate treatment decisions, such as referral to  nephrology, placement of /f_istula, and referral for transplant evaluation.  People with CKD have elevated risks for cardiovascular outcomes including heart  failure, myocardial infarction and stroke. Estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk  should be assessed using a validat

One example is the  PREVENT equation that was derived from large populations in the United States. Special considerations should be given for CKD care across the lifespan (Figure  3). Use a personalized approach, considering age, sex, and gender for diagno- sis, risk assessment, and treatment. At the extremes of age - the very young and  the

Treat people with CKD with a comprehen- sive treatment strategy to reduce risks for complications (e.g., cardiovas- cular disease) and for progression to more advanced stages of CKD; ideal  strategies encompass education, lifestyle, exercise, smoking cessation,  diet, and medications, where in
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Top-10-Takeaways-for-PCPs-Management.pdf	moking cessation,  diet, and medications, where indicated (Figure 1).  Adopting a healthy and diverse diet with a higher consumption of  plant-based foods compared to animal-based foods and a lower  consumption of ultra-processed foods has the potential to bene/f_it  complications related to progressive CKD such as acidosis, hyperkalemia,  and hyperphosphatemia with less risk of protein energy-wasting. Ideal BP target in CKD is <120/80 mm Hg; however, BP-lowering therapy  should be individualize
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Top-10-Takeaways-for-PCPs-Management.pdf	ever, BP-lowering therapy  should be individualized in people with frailty, high risk of falls and  fractures, very limited life expectancy, or symptomatic postural hypoten- sion (Figure 1). Evidence-based treatments that delay progression of CKD include  renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RASi) and SGLT2i in people with and  without diabetes. In people with CKD and without diabetes, the presence  of even mild albuminuria indicates bene/f_its from RASi, and severe  albuminuria indicates substantial b
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Top-10-Takeaways-for-PCPs-Management.pdf	i, and severe  albuminuria indicates substantial bene/f_its from SGLT2i.  Estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk using a validated risk tool that  incorporates CKD to guide treatment for prevention of cardiovascular  disease. Use statins for most people with CKD to prevent cardiovascular  disease (Figure 1). In people with CKD and heart failure, SGLT2i confers  bene/f_its irrespective of albuminuria.  Changes in eGFR are expected following initiation of hemodynamically  active therapies, but GFR r
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Top-10-Takeaways-for-PCPs-Management.pdf	on of hemodynamically  active therapies, but GFR reductions of ≥30% on subsequent testing  exceed the expected variability and warrant evaluation (Figure 2). Perform thorough medication review periodically and at transitions of  care to assess adherence, continued indication, and potential drug  interactions. People with CKD have increased risk for adverse events due  to over-the-counter medicines, dietary, or herbal remedies, so encourage  your patients to limit their use.  For most people and
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Top-10-Takeaways-for-PCPs-Management.pdf	patients to limit their use.  For most people and clinical settings, validated eGFR equations using SCr  are appropriate for drug-dosing, but the combined eGFRcr-cys is more  accurate and should be used when a more accurate kidney function  estimation is important. If medications are discontinued during an acute illness, communicate a  clear plan of when to restart the discontinued medications and ensure  documentation in the medical record. Unfortunately, medications are  frequently not restart
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline-Top-10-Takeaways-for-PCPs-Management.pdf	rtunately, medications are  frequently not restarted, which leads to undertreatment and uninten- tional harm. Common reasons for referral to specialist kidney care services include the  evaluation of cause of CKD, GFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2, signi/f_icant decline in  GFR, >3%–5% risk of requiring KRT in 5 years, signi/f_icant albuminuria,  microscopic hematuria, changes in symptoms, or management of CKD  complications.21 43 65 87 109Comprehensive treatment strategy Healthy and diverse diet Individua

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization was established in 2003 with the mission toimprove the care and outcomes of people living with kidneydisease worldwide. The development and implementation ofglobal clinical practice guidelines is central to the many ac- tivities of KDIGO to ful ﬁll its mission. Twenty years later, we are excited to present this update of the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	actice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to complement the existing 12 guidelines that address various other facets of kidneydisease management. Our aspiration is that the KDIGO CKD Guideline serves as a comprehensive reference for evidence-based practices, of- fering clear and valuable guidance for the optimal diagnosis and treatment of CKD. The updated guideline is the result ofa rigorous process, extensively detailed in the KDIGOMethods Manual. To pro
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	sively detailed in the KDIGOMethods Manual. To promote objectivity and transparency,we screen Guideline Co-Chairs and Work Group members(which include clinicians, researchers, and patients) for con-ﬂicts of interest. Over a span of 2 –3 years, these individuals volunteer their time, starting with the creation of a Scope of Work that undergoes an open public review to engage all stakeholders. This document is then adapted into a Requestfor Proposal, which is used to enlist an independent Evidence
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	l, which is used to enlist an independent EvidenceReview Team. The Evidence Review Team conducts a systematic review of existing literature, extracting studies with appropriate designand outcomes deemed important by both people with CKDand clinicians. All work is meticulously graded on study quality and potential bias, forming the basis for quantifying the overall certainty of the evidence using the “Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evalua-tion”(GRADE) approach.

Thus, guidelines are the result of a rigorous andobjective assessment of available evidence, enriched by thecollective expertise of healthcare providers, researchers, and patients alike.

We hope thatthe guideline will serve as a useful tool for clinicians in theirdaily practice, providing clear insight into the evidence-basedrecommendations while highlighting areas requiring further research. Ultimately, our aim is to facilitate more effective and consistent care to patients with CKD worldwide, and thepublication of the CKD Guideline will provide the foundationof many dissemination and implementation activities to in-cr

This guidelineidenti ﬁes the suitability of medical interventions that can improve or delay the seriousness of CKD and possible kidneyfailure. In a complicated world of health provision, having a set of evidential recommendations and practice points provideskidney service providers with the targets
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	provideskidney service providers with the targets for a quality CKDservice for people with kidney disease. However, if the startingpoint for many people is ignorance of what a kidney actuallydoes, then without a holistic approach to patient care, much ofthe potential effectiveness of medical interventions can bediluted because of patient circumstances and psychologicalchallenges. Acceptance of the seriousness of CKD can take a lot longer for a person to process, to the possible detriment ofmedic
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	rson to process, to the possible detriment ofmedical intervention, and may well lead to issues over adherence. A controlled, managed CKD decline is so bene ﬁcial to patients who have so many social issues to contend with, be it diet, tiredness, liquid control, pill overload, and a deep diveinto the very mechanics of how we eat and drink to surviveand excrete excesses. In an ever-increasingly busy world of medical care, as pa- tients, we believe that the best approach is for any physician to aim
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	hat the best approach is for any physician to aim to achieve a partnership of knowledge with the patient regarding their CKD care. This will build patient con ﬁdence and self-awareness, with the aim that any patient who sadly arrives atpossible dialysis is in the right state of mind, which is critical for aconsidered approach to the next stage of a patient ’s journey.

The past 10 years have provided new hope for improved treatment of CKD. A greater understanding of healthy lifestyleand lifestyle modi ﬁcations toge
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	healthy lifestyleand lifestyle modi ﬁcations together with new medications and technologies furnish improved options for treatment andmonitoring of CKD. People with CKD, healthcare providers,and health systems are eager to implement these advances in the most effective and evidence-based manner. This requires integration of new therapies with lifestyle management andexisting medications using approaches that engage patientsand optimize application of health resources. The goal of thisguideline

The majorityof statements from the 2012 guideline have been updatedbased on current knowledge and practice. Only 6 statementswere retained in their original form in 2012. As Co-Chairs, we would like to recognize the outstanding efforts of the Work Group, the Evidence Review Team (ERT),and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)staff. The Work Group was diverse, multinational, multidis-ciplinary, exp

Notably,the Work Group included 2 members who have CKD whocontributed actively as peers to keep the guideline relevantand patient-centered. We are indebted to each and every in- dividual who contributed to this process. We hope that the guidance provided here will help improve the care of peoplewith CKD worldwide. The KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline was built on the United States (US)-based Kidney Disease Outcomes Qu

It reinforced the de ﬁnition of CKD incorporating a persistent reduction in glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) and markers of kidney damage and modi ﬁed the staging and classi ﬁcation system to include elements that had begun to be appreciated by the clinical community.3 Speci ﬁcally, the 2012 guideline intro
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	community.3 Speci ﬁcally, the 2012 guideline introduced the concept of a “CGA”classi ﬁcation of CKD based on cause (C), level of kidney function determined by GFR (G), and degree ofalbuminuria (A). The CGA classi ﬁcation laid a foundation upon which management, treatment, research, and riskassessment of CKD have since been based. The de ﬁnition, staging, and classi ﬁcation of CKD pro- posed by the KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline have been widelyaccepted and implemented worldwide. Research has sincehigh
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	and implemented worldwide. Research has sincehighlighted that higher speci ﬁc stages or categories of CKD, characterized by level of GFR and albuminuria independently,portend greater relative risk (RR) for adverse outcomes. 4–7 These include, but are not limited to, CKD progression,cardiovascular disease (CVD), mortality (all-cause and car-diovascular), kidney failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI).The development of risk-prediction tools has re ﬁned moni- toring and referral to specialist neph

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	es and associated recommendations for care, it is critically important to consider the individual in front of you, their preferences,and their individual risks and bene ﬁts. We recognize that the threshold GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2(GFR categories G3a –G5) for >3 months to indicate a diagnosis of CKD is well below the average in young adult men andwomen, 13but because a signi ﬁcant GFR reduction in younger people is also usually associated with other markers of kidney disease, the diagnosis of
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	other markers of kidney disease, the diagnosis of CKD would be captured. Similarly, we recognize that there is an average age-associated GFR decline observed in longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, 14but with substantial variation among individuals within the population,15such that not all individuals will have a signi ﬁcant GFR decline with age.12 This guideline is not intended to be a textbook, and thus statements regarding prevention and screening for CKD, although important topics, are

For a more detailed discussion of theseissues, we refer readers to existing textbooks and reviews. 16–18 Prevention and screening for CKD should be conductedmostly by healthcare providers in primary care and in otherspecialties, such as endocrinology, cardiology, and oncology,rather than restricted to nephrologists. We strongly suppo

We strongly support efforts aimed at the early detection and treatment of CKD among people at high risk for CKD, including those withhypertension, diabetes, and CVD. Screening efforts in theseand other populations should include assessments of GFR(estimated or in certain situations measured [see Section 1.2] and albuminuria [or surrogate, see Section 1.3]).

CKD is de ﬁned as abnormalities of kidney structure or function, present for a minimum of 3 months, with implications for health ( Table 1 ).1 Classifying CKD. CKD is classi ﬁed based on Cause, GFR category (G1 –G5), and Albuminuria category (A1 –A3), abbreviated as CGA .1These 3 components of the classi ﬁcation
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	as CGA .1These 3 components of the classi ﬁcation system are each critical in the assessment of people with CKD and help enable determination of severityand risk. Listed below are reference tables describing eachcomponent. Note that while the de ﬁnition of CKD includes many different markers of kidney damage and is notconﬁned to decreased GFR and albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) >30 mg/g [> 3 mg/mmol], the classi ﬁcation system is based on the 2 dimensions of GFR and degree of albuminuria ( Tab
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	dimensions of GFR and degree of albuminuria ( Tables 2 and 3). This nuance is often missed by healthcare providers and students. It is well established that patient advocates with CKD and healthcare providers prefer the more clinically useful and generally understood assessment of GFR resulting from theuse of GFR estimating equations compared with serumcreatinine (SCr) alone. Globally, although still not universallyavailable in all countries, SCr is measured routinely and the approach to assess
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	r is measured routinely and the approach to assessment of GFR is therefore to use SCr and an estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR. Theapproach to evaluation of GFR using initial and supportivetests is described in greater detail in Chapter 1. Etiology of CKD should be sought, and there are numerous systems for grouping various etiologies, some ofwhich are evolving with new knowledge and diagnostic tools.There are congenital and genetic causes of CKD, some asso- ciated with systemic
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ic causes of CKD, some asso- ciated with systemic diseases, and others that are primary. It is beyond our remit to suggest a speci ﬁc approach, but we highlight the importance of establishing a cause to individ-ualize management of CKD. The global burden of CKD The Global Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk FactorsStudy (GBD) pulls together data on premature death anddisability from more than 350 diseases and injuries in 204 countries, by age and sex, from 1990 to the present. 24Disease “burde

Globally, in 2017, a systematic analysis from the all-age GBD project found 697.5 million (95% uncertainty interval[UI]: 649.2 –752.0) ca
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	on (95% uncertainty interval[UI]: 649.2 –752.0) cases of all-stage CKD, for a global preva- lence of 9.1% (8.5% –9.8%). 25By 2021, a joint statement from the American Society of Nephrology, European RenalAssociation, and International Society of Nephrologyindicated that more than 850 million people suffer fromsome form of kidney disease, roughly double the number ofpeople who live with diabetes (422 million) and 20 times more than the prevalence of cancer worldwide (42 million) or people living
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	of cancer worldwide (42 million) or people living with AIDS/HIV (36.7 million). Theseestimates derive from aggregation of studies worldwide,which have applied a variety of de ﬁnitions of CKD; nevertheless, they furnish the best guide about global CKDprevalence. In 2017, CKD was estimated to account for 35.8 million (95% UI: 33.7 e38.0) DALYs, and 1.2 million people died from CKD. Most of the burden of CKD was concentrated inthe 3 lowest quintiles of sociodemographic index (SDI). In2019, CKD was

In2019, CKD was responsible for 41.5 million (95% UI: 38.3 – 45.0) DALYs, and 1.43 million people died from CKD. 24Age- standardized DALY rates (Figure 224) were highest in central and Andean Latin America, at 1348.1 (1203.6 –1521.6) and 836.3 (704.2 –981.6) per 100,000, respectively (global rate was 514.9 [474.9 –558.9]).

Overall, CKD and its effect on CVD resulted in 2.6 million (95% UI: 2.4 –2.8) deaths in 2017 and CKD has risen from 19th to 11th in rank amongleading causes of death between 1990 and 2019 due toaging and an increasing burden of risk

Screening and prevention Despite the increasing recognition of the true burden of CKD,there remains controversy and lack of consensus as to the utility of population screening for CKD 26or targeted screening programs,18due to the complexity of the underlying sociopolitical and resource environment. Public health policy has a ro

Public health policy has a role to play in identifying andaddressing risk factors to prevent CKD, to identify CKDearly, and to delay its progression and associated adverseoutcomes. Education of both health personnel and thepopulations at risk, implementation of early kidney disease detection programs, and incorporation of evidence-based treatment of CKD and its associated conditions, such as BPand diabetes, are all essential components of a strategy toaddress this burden. A
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	components of a strategy toaddress this burden. A systematic review suggested thatscreening for CKD is cost- effective in people with diabetes and hypertension, the 2 most common causes of CKDworldwide. 16However, clinical trials have not been conducted to determine whether or not an intervention to detect, risk -stratify, and treat CKD would improve the health outcomes for the targeted population. Nevertheless, cost-effective analysis of population -wide screening for CKD incorporating evidence
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ion -wide screening for CKD incorporating evidence -based treatment with sodium -glucose cotransporter -2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) recently concluded that screening adults for albuminuria to identifyCKD could be cost -effective in the United States. 27 This evidence aligns with the KDIGO Controversies Con- ference on Early Detection and Intervention in CKD, whichconcluded that early identi ﬁcation of CKD in people at risk, who are usually asymptomatic, would likely be bene ﬁcial in the community and
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	, would likely be bene ﬁcial in the community and primary care settings if the programs areinterwoven with risk strati ﬁcation and treatment. 17A community program must be able to provide treatment tothe high-risk group of patients with newly detected CKD tojustify systematic early detection strategies. An additionalconclusion was that screening and treatment programs forCKD should be implemented based on risk strati ﬁcation to prioritize people, particularly in settings with limitedeconomic res
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	particularly in settings with limitedeconomic resources. Although globally people withhypertension, diabetes, or CVD are at high risk for CKD, other high-risk people may be identi ﬁed through genetic risk factors or by varying exposure to environmental pollution, pesticides, water, and nephrotoxic medications includingsigniﬁcant analgesic use and herbal medications, depending on geographical region. Frameworks in which to considerspeciﬁc regional factors have been offered to facilitate discussi

Impor-tant to note is that patient advocates with CKD strongly arguefor earlier CKD screening and diagnosis. 17They also advocate for CKD detection to be integrated with patient and familyeducation and engagement to improve accessi

For type 1 diabetes (T1D), screening is recommended commencing 5 years after diagnosis. The overall costs of a screening program are largely driven by the frequency ofrepeat screening, so the timing of repeated tes

There are risk equations available toestimate the interval risk of developing CKD, and this riskstratiﬁcation could guide repeat testing intervals. 30International considerations In low- and middle-income regions of the world and in thelower sociodemographic quintiles, there is a large gap betweenCKD burden and provision of adequate healthcare.

Standardization/accuracy of testing tools including assays/equipment The KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline built on recommendations made to clinical laboratories in the earlier KDOQI 2002guidance. Clinical laboratories were speci ﬁcally charged with measuring SCr and serum cystatin C using assays with cali-bration traceable to
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	tin C using assays with cali-bration traceable to the international standard referencematerials recommending that, for SCr, there should be minimal bias compared with isotope-dilution mass spec- trometry. 1Recommendations were also made with respect to measurement and reporting of albumin and protein in theurine. Although some of the recommendations havebecome part of routine practice, the effective use of clinicalguidelines and therefore effective patient care, includingaccurate diagnosis and r
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ve patient care, includingaccurate diagnosis and referral prioritization, clinicalresearch, and public health prioritization, require comparability of laboratory results independent of time, place, and measurement procedure. Key to this isestablishing precision and between-laboratory agreementwith traceability to accepted reference standards whereveravailable. Therefore, this guidance document includesstandards for laboratory tests. The InternationalConsortium for Harmonization of Clinical Labor
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	onalConsortium for Harmonization of Clinical LaboratoryResults (ICHLR) was established to create a pathway for harmonization and aid implementation of clinical guidelines recommending the use of laboratory tests in the diagnosisand management of disease, 33ensuring that both reference materials and test methodology are harmonized. TheICHLR aimed to prioritize measurands by medicalimportance and both coordinate and stimulate developmentof technical and regulatory processes to achieveharmonization

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	important intersectional factors including but not limited to geographical location, socioeconomic status (SES), and race and ethnicity, playimportant roles in kidney health and disease. Here we introduce concepts as to why age, sex, and gender should be considered in the context of diagnosis, treatment,and care planning in people with CKD. In addition, thespeciﬁc guideline chapters incorporate statements where special considerations regarding age, sex, and gender are relevant to clinical pract

Considerations in children and adolescents When the guideline refers to people with CKD, this includes children (people <10 years old) and adolescents (people10–19 years old). When there are altered care recommenda- tions and practice points due to the unique needs of childrenor the lack of data to inform recommendations and practicepoints, these considerations are discussed within the Pediatric considerations sections of t
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	within the Pediatric considerations sections of the guideline. The management of children and adolescents with CKD needs special consideration ( Figure 4 ). Children and adults have different etiologies of CKD. Up to 40% –50% of childhood CKD is due to congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract(CAKUT); the younger the CKD population, the greater theproportion with CAKUT as the cause. 35,36CAKUT is characterized by slower progression to kidney failure and a higher likelihood of polyur

Although nephron formation is complete by 36 weeks of gestation, kidney function continues to develop throughoutearly childhood, with nephron growth and maturation pro- gressing particularly rapidly in the ﬁrst year of life. An actual increase in GFR over the course of the ﬁrst 1 –2 years of life, and even up to 4 years of age, is expected. A traj

A trajectory of increasing GFR in infancy and very early childhood followed by a period ofrelative stability and a subsequent progression in CKD inadolescence or adulthood is common. Given the long life ex-pectancy of children, follow-up plans must take into accountthe risk of late CKD or kidney failure. Healthy children and adolescents should have excellent kidney function, so an esti- mated eGFR under 90 ml/min per 1.73 m 2(CKD G2 –G5) represents dec

Earlyassessment and intervention of children with CKD is crucial tomaximize overall health across the lifespan. Neurodevelopment and education. A primary goal of pedi- atric CKD care is to optimize neurodevelopmental gains.CKD can affect development, cognition, school attendance, vocational outcomes, and future employment. Mitigating these de ﬁcits through effective, individualized care is essential to

Considerations in older adults Older adults constitute a substantial and steadily growingproportion of people under nephrology and medical careglobally, especially in Western industrialized countries.Longevity in many parts of the world is increasing, and thusthe prevalence of CKD in those people is also increasing. The2022 US Renal Data System (USRDS) annual data reporthighlights that the number o

In Taiwan, for example, KRT incidence in those aged 75 þwas 2858 per million population (pmp) compared with 1583 pmp among people aged 65 –74 years, 530 pmp among people aged 45 –64 years, and 97 pmp among people aged 20 –44 years. The pattern is very similar across the globe with the majority ofpeople initiating dialysis over the age of 75, which putsemphasis on a group o

Octo- and nonagenarians often demonstrate distinct patterns of disease complexity. These features include multi-morbidity often accompanied by polypharmacy, frailty,cognitive impairment, and gerontopsychiatric disordersamong others. Often, several of these features coexist espe-cially in older adults with CKD. Implications for aging adults with C
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	lts with CKD. Implications for aging adults with CKD are important in both diagnosis and treatment. The interpretation of labora- tory results (speci ﬁcally SCr) used in the staging system should factor in an older adult ’s habitus given the frequency of sarcopenia. A creatinine-based eGFR (eGFRcr) will over- estimate GFR in the elderly (and others) with sarcopenialeading to drug overdosing. Urine ACR at the same time willbe falsely high due to the falsely low creatinine in the de-nominator. Fur
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	he falsely low creatinine in the de-nominator. Furthermore, the presence of frailty may altertreatment targets recommended for younger people with CKD, as they may not necessarily be transferable to older adults. Strict BP-lowering, for example, may come with therisk of dizziness, falls, and fractures in older adults, many ofwhom are on anticoagulants risking severe hemorrhage. The multidimensionality of comorbidities in old age poses challenges, as it demands a sophisticated integrated andcompl
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	as it demands a sophisticated integrated andcomplex multidisciplinary care and treatment approach,which may not be available in every healthcare system. Life expectancy in old age is naturally limited compared with younger people. Perspectives and treatment goals shift overthe life course, and recognizing these in very old adults, asdifferent from those in middle-aged or younger adults withCKD, is critical to the development of more personalized careplans and goals. Speci ﬁcally, pure survival
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	careplans and goals. Speci ﬁcally, pure survival may become less of a priority for an older individual, whereas maintaining anacceptable, good quality of life (QoL) may be more impor- tant. The context of a person ’s situation and own values and preferences may modify the prioritization for testing, treat- ment types, and treatment goals. For example, the decision-making between KRT and conservative care should be madeon the basis of the person ’s priorities, medical needs, and informed decisio

These informed decisions require good communicationbetween caregivers, people with CKD, and their relatives/ carers; they require time, “room, ”adequate understandable language, patience, trust, and commitment. Repeated con- versations are critical, given the higher prevalence of cognitivedeﬁcits in older adults with CKD. These cognitive issues accompany both aging and CKD and frequently remain un-

Globally, the prevalence of CKD not being treated with dialysis de ﬁned by level of eGFR is greater in women than men. 40Progression of CKD has been reported as more rapid in men,41,42in women,43or no difference by sex or gender.44 These incongruities are likely a reﬂ ection of differences in cause of kidney disease and de ﬁnitions of outcomes (e.g., loss of eGFR or receipt of KRT). There is substantial literature demonstrating that both sex- and gender-related fa

Forexample, women are more likely to report adverse reactions to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), 46which play a role in adherence and failure to reach guideline- recommended target doses. There are differences between women and men in the detection, recognition, monitoring, referra

In this section, we highlight newer data derived fromthe CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC)
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	derived fromthe CKD Prognosis Consortium (CKD-PC). 12We describe the associations of CKD categories with 10 of these important outcomes and demonstrate the importance of different methods of estimating GFR (i.e., using creatinine-or cystatin C –based equations) on these risk gradients. Healthcare providers, researchers, and policy makers should understand the association of CKD parameters (ACRand eGFR) in populations. The overall distributions ofepidemiological risk across CKD categories on a p

In this section, we provide an update to these CKD heatmaps, which havebeen provided by the CKD-PC. 12 Several changes in the development of these updated heatmaps are important to highlight. (i) They now include several clinical databases that allow a much larger population base, comprising up to 27,503,140people for the analyses of each adverse outcome. (ii) The eGFRcr has been changed to th

(iii) The number of outcomes has been increased to 10, including 6 that are cardiovascular related, 2 that arekidney speci ﬁc (kidney failure and AKI), and 2 general outcomes (all-cause mortality and all-causehospitalization). (iv) Additional analyses have been conducted using the 2021 CKD-EPI combined eGFR equation that incorp

Although the sample sizefor these subsequent analyses is much smaller (n ¼ 720,736), it does permit better differentiation of associ-ations of eGFR and risk and allows validation of CKDthresholds across populations. CKD staging by eGFRcr and ACR and association with adverse events Figure 512presents the RRs for all eGFR/ACR combinations for the 10 identi ﬁed outcomes. The RRs presented have all been adjusted

The RRs presented have all been adjusted for age, sex, smoking status (current, former, or never), systolic BP (SBP), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol,body mass index (BMI), use of antihypertensive medications,and a medical history of diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial ﬁbrillation, peripheral artery dis- ease, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Therefore, the RRs can be interpreted as the proportionalelevation in

Across all the heatmaps, a consistentcolor scheme is used. Theﬁgures reveal several common themes and highlight the necessity of having both eGFR and ACR parametersavailable in assessing risk.

Forthe 8 outcomes that are not in ﬂuenced by changes in creatinine (all except kidney failure and AKI), eGFRcrexhibited a J-shaped association such that risk increasedwith eGFR

In contrast, eGFRcr-cys demonstrated much more linear associations with each of these complicationsthroughout its distribution. Based upon the risk relationships of eGFRcr-cys and ACR categories with all complications, the existing CKD staging is appropriate among both younger and older adults. Some authors have suggested that the GFR threshold for CKD of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2should be raised to
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	CKD of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2should be raised to 75 ml/min per 1.73 m2for younger adults and lowered to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2for older adults.55In younger adults, the purpose of a higher GFR threshold re ﬂects the longer risk horizon for younger people, which could lead to higher lifetime CKD progression risks for a given GFR stage. However, the higher lifetime progression risks in younger adults withGFR 60 –89 ml/min per 1.73 m 2can be addressed in their management without changing the de ﬁnit
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	d in their management without changing the de ﬁnition of CKD.Efforts should be directed at people with higher risk withGFR levels >60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2to prevent the incidence of CKD or further reductions in GFR. Among older adults, the ﬁndings of consistently elevated RR for older adults with CKD G3a, A1, as de ﬁned by eGFRcr- cys, support the inclusion of this large group in the CKD population. These elevated RRs tell us how much more likely the outcome is compared with the reference group (
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	the outcome is compared with the reference group (eGFR 90 – 104 ml/min per 1.73 m2and ACR <10 mg/g [< 1 mg/ mmol]). Crucially, they do not tell us what the overall like-lihood of the outcome, the absolute risk, is. The absolute riskfor important CKD complications is higher among older thanyounger adults at nearly every stage, particularly for CVD,heart failure, and mortality. Therefore, this population is also likely to bene ﬁt from having their CKD diagnosed, staged, and treated. Rationale for
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	CKD diagnosed, staged, and treated. Rationale for using cystatin C containing equations for CKD staging The rationale for using cystatin C versus SCr, or a combi- nation of both, in eGFR equations is that creatinine, which isdirectly linked to muscle mass, may be misleading at extremes of body habitus, or in speci ﬁc conditions (spinal cord injuries and sarcopenia), and that cystatin C is impacted by different variables (steroid use, thyroid disease, and cancer).

Practice Point 3.7.2: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis). Recommendation 3.7.2: We recommend treating adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A): /C15eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m2with urine ACR ‡200 mg/g ( ‡20 mg/mmol), or /C15heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria. Practice Point 3.7.3: SGLT2i initiation or

Practice Point 3.7.3: SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy. Recommendation 3.7.3: We suggest treating adults with eGFR 20 to 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2with urine ACR <200 mg/g ( <20 mg/mmol) with an SGLT2i (2B). 3.8 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) The Work Group highlights a key recommendation and practice points from the KDIGO

In the decade since the publication of the previous KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management ofChronic Kidney Disease, 1there have been substantial advances in treatment for CKD of all causes (Chapter 3), targetedtherapies for speci ﬁc causes of CKD (e.g., KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management ofGlomerular Diseases 22), as well as understanding of and methods to determine the etiology of CKD. All together,
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ds to determine the etiology of CKD. All together, these advances have the potential to slow and possibly prevent the progression of kidney disease. Thus, in this section of Chapter1, we emphasize the importance of detecting CKD, andconsiderations for the optimal methods for staging of CKD,and how to establish chronicity and etiology. 1.1.1 Detection of CKD Practice Point 1.1.1.1: Test people at risk for and with chronickidney disease (CKD) using both urine albumin measurementand assessment of g

Becausetreatments for CKD provide bene ﬁts in reducing risk for both CVD and CKD progression, strategies that promote earlydetection of CKD should improve kidney and non –kidney- related outcomes. Even if medical treatments are not available or indic
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	n if medical treatments are not available or indicated for an individual, there are recommended lifestyle changes that could be implemented after the diagnosis of CKD(Chapter 3). Interviews with people who have CKD have pro-vided evidence that many would alter their lifestyle if theyreceived a diagnosis of CKD. 17Knowledge of level of albuminuria and GFR also helps guide clinical decisionsbeyond initiating treatments speci ﬁcally for CKD ( Table 4 ). Each of these is considered in greater depth
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	4 ). Each of these is considered in greater depth in the subsequent chapters. Finally, if a familial form of kidney disease is suspected, the diagnosis of the disease in one person mayallow detection in other family members. Thus, initial testingof blood and urine to detect CKD is important, withconﬁrmatory testing if initial ﬁndings indicate the presence of abnormalities of creatinine/eGFR or albuminuria. From a societal perspective, early identi ﬁcation of and intervention for CKD could have a
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	i ﬁcation of and intervention for CKD could have a positive impact on health disparities. In many countries, there is a higher incidence of CKD among people with lower SES, and these people are more likelyto progress to kidney failure and have less access to KRT (dialysis Table 4 | Use of GFR and albuminuria Clinical decisionsCurrent level Change in the level of GFR GFR Albuminuria Diagnosis and staging/C15Detection of CKD /C15Evaluation for kidney donation/C15Detection of CKD /C15Detection of A

Dis-

Dis-cussions around disease detection are common in the primarycare setting, and shared decision-making is an establishedpractice through which people may agree to the testing,conﬁrm that they would like to be tested, and prepare for the range of possible results and their implications. 58–60Early detection increases burden and costs associated with physi-cian visits or treatments, and this may not be balanced bysavings from averting adverse outcomes
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	balanced bysavings from averting adverse outcomes. CKD ﬁts the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for an early detection program. 61–63Given that chronic disease detection and prevention frameworks have been deployed forother disease and risk factor conditions, in our view, CKDdetection strategies should be implemented for high-risk people. A framework has been developed for communities to align CKD detection and treatment strategies within their broaderpublic health priorities to ensure
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	n their broaderpublic health priorities to ensure that the goals of the interven-tion are achieved without compromising other valuable healthinitiatives. 26Both the ef ﬁcacy and the cost-effectiveness of CKD detection and treatment interventions will depend upon thespeciﬁc strategies that are employed in the healthcare system. Therefore, results from future clinical trials should be evaluated within their unique context and may not generalize to all CKD detection efforts. Most people with or at
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	all CKD detection efforts. Most people with or at risk for CKD, healthcare providers, and policy makers would wish to identify CKD. Most people who arealready receiving medical care would choose case- ﬁnding stra- tegies to enable earlier risk strati ﬁcation and treatment for pre- viously undiagnosed CKD. 17,64Thus, the application of earlier treatment to delay CKD progression in people with CKD is of a higher priority than the lack of clinical trial evidence that case-ﬁnding strategies themselv
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	rial evidence that case-ﬁnding strategies themselves improve outcomes. This practice point promoting CKD detection efforts may have implications for health equity, because CKD dispro-portionately affects people from minoritized populations andthose who have lower SES. The increasing availability andevidence supporting several treatments for CKD advocates forearly disease detection. Given the asymptomatic progression of CKD, systematic testing of people with risk factors for CKD is the only metho
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	people with risk factors for CKD is the only method that would detect CKD at earlystages and allow the initiation of appropriate treatments.CKD detection could reduce the proportion of people withCKD who will experience the morbidity of CKD G4 –G5. Cost-effectiveness analyses, performed in the new era ofeffective disease-modifying therapies, describe a more positiveview of population-wide screening. 27 Figure 328provides an algorithm for the identi ﬁcation of people at risk for CKD testing in th

Primarycare physicians or other medical specialists who care forpeople with risk factors for CKD, such as endocrinology,cardiology, or rheumatology, are ideal settings for an intervention that targets people with undetected CKD. Implementing an early detection intervention would befacilitated by integrated healthcare
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ntion would befacilitated by integrated healthcare systems and the use ofelectronic health records. These structures would facilitatethe linkage between risk strati ﬁcation and treatment to have the desired effect of slowing the progression of CKD. The highest priority conditions for CKD detection are hypertension, diabetes, and CVD, including heart failure. For diabetes, the ADA and KDIGO recommend annual screening of people with diabetes for CKD. 29CKD screening should start at diagnosis of T2
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	D. 29CKD screening should start at diagnosis of T2D because evidence of CKD is oftenalready apparent at this time. For T1D, screening isrecommended commencing 5 years after diagnosis. Asecond important group includes people with recent AKI oracute kidney disease (AKD), particularly multiple episodesof AKI, and those who have been “partially diagnosed ”with CKD by either eGFR or albuminuria but cannot be fullystaged. Other groups who might be considered for CKDtesting are shown in Table 5 . This
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	idered for CKDtesting are shown in Table 5 . This list is not exhaustive and may be modi ﬁed by local epidemiological considerations. As per above, 2023 analyses suggest that population screeningmay in fact be cost-effective, obviating the need for“selecting ”and addressing an ever-changing list of “at risk ” groups. 27 Testing for CKD without regard to age generates contro- versy. Those in older age groups experience the greatestburden of CKD and are also at the highest risk for cardio-vascular
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	d are also at the highest risk for cardio-vascular complications. As with other detection programs likecancer detection, CKD detection efforts should be individu-alized based on the person ’s goals of care and suitability for treatment. Practice Point 1.1.1.2: Following incidental detection of elevated urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), he-maturia, or low estimated GFR (eGFR), repeat tests toconﬁrm presence of CKD. There is known biological and analytical variability in SCr and in urine

In people withoutrisk factors for CKD, there is a low pretest probability for CKD. Thus, any unexpected results should be veri ﬁed before diagnosing a person as having CKD. In people with risk factors for CKD, there is a higher probability that the persondoes have CKD even with an unexpected ﬁnding. Subsequent testing should be performed to con ﬁrm the diagnosis
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	sting should be performed to con ﬁrm the diagnosis and to complete the evaluation, as is required. Timing of the repeatsample should be determined based on clinical settingincluding risk factors for CKD as well as concern for AKI/ AKD. Hematuria is common and associated with risk for sub- sequent development of CKD. 65There are several causes ofchapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S170 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 transient hematuria. Persistent hematuria may indicate
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ient hematuria. Persistent hematuria may indicate glomerular disease, other kidney diseases, or urologicdisease including genitourinary malignancy. Thus, persistent hematuria should prompt further investigation. 66,67 Special considerations Pediatric considerations. People who are born preterm, especially if also small for gestational age, are at increased riskfor CKD and kidney failure. This is largely related to decreased nephron number. 68–70Additional insults after birth such as neonatal AKI
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	dditional insults after birth such as neonatal AKI and childhood obesity can further in-crease the risk of CKD. 71,72 1.1.2 Methods for staging of CKD Recommendation 1.1.2.1: In adults at risk for CKD, we recommend using creatinine-based estimatedglomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFRcr). If cystatin C is available, the GFR category should be estimatedfrom the combination of creatinine and cystatin C(creatinine and cystatin C –based estimated glomer- ularﬁltration rate [eGFRcr-cys]) (1B). For the diagn
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	arﬁltration rate [eGFRcr-cys]) (1B). For the diagnosis and staging of CKD by GFR, this recom- mendation puts a high value on data suggesting that the most accurate method of estimating GFR is by using 2 biomarkers(cystatin C and creatinine), as each has limitations and bene ﬁts asﬁltration markers. As compared with mGFR, estimatingequations using both creatinine and cystatin C afford greateraccuracy in comparison with either ﬁltration marker alone. The recommendation places a lower value on the
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	e. The recommendation places a lower value on the resource utilization and cost associated with the assessment of eGFRcr-cys. Key information Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. In the CKD-PC collabora- tion, 720,736 people had measures of blood cystatin C in addi-tion to having eGFRcr and ACR. 12Replacing the assessment of eGFRcr with eGFRcr-cys in the matrix of GFR categories led to several changes in the risk distributions. Most notably, thegroup with an eGFR category 45 –59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2and
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ith an eGFR category 45 –59 ml/min per 1.73 m 2and ACR<10 mg/g ( <1 mg/mmol) was moved to higher risk for all 10 outcomes, and this category was no longer labeledas being low-risk ( “green ”) for any of the complications (Figure 6 12). For the 8 outcomes that are not in ﬂuenced by changes in creatinine (i.e. all except kidney failure and AKI),eGFRcr exhibited a J-shaped association such that riskincreased with eGFR values >105 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (Figure 712). In contrast eGFRcr-cys demonstrated
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	(Figure 712). In contrast eGFRcr-cys demonstrated much more linear associations with each of these complicationsthroughout its distribution. These data demonstrate that thecombined eGFRcr-cys equation is superior for distinguishingGFR risk stages compared with eGFRcr. Certainty of evidence. This recommendation is based on 2 broadly different types of data —data comparing the accuracy (P30) of equations from a combination of creatinine and cystatin C as ﬁltration markers and creatinine and cysta

As compared with equations based on creatinineand cystatin C alone, the equation using both creatinine and cystatin C comes closest to mGFR most consistently (Supplementary Table S3 73–96). The CKD-PC data were an individual-level data analysis of 27,503,140 participantsfrom 114 global cohorts (eGFRcr) and 720,736 participantsfrom

This recommendation places a high value on the need for the most accurate asses

For this reason, the Work Group prioritized eGFRcr-cys over eGFRcr or eGFRcys for the most accurate measurement. The recommendation puts alow value on the availability and cost of an assessment ofeGFRcr-cys suggesting that people at risk of CKD would optfor the more accurate assessment. Reso

The costs and resource use associ- ated with eGFRcr-cys are currently greater than those ofeGFRcr; however, the need for an accurate measurement may offset these expenses. In addition, accurate diagnosis of CKD as early as possible may lead to lower resource utilization andhealthcare spending than if diagnosed in later stages of CKD.For more information on the costs associated with cystatin Cassessments, please refer to Sectio

The biggest consideration for implementation is the availability of cystatin C measurement.For this reason, the recommendation includes the alternative for eGFRcr in such cases taking into consideration the limitations and drawbacks of creatinine-based measurements. Rationale The KDIGO CKD staging system based on 2 dimensions,GFR and albuminuria, was created largely to re ﬂect the as- sociation of outc
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	eated largely to re ﬂect the as- sociation of outcomes of people with CKD, relative to theearlier staging systems based solely on GFR stages. Assessmentof GFR stage is ideally performed using accurate assessmentof GFR and ACR and is used to best capture the prognosis for people with CKD with regard to outcomes such as kidney failure, CVD, and mortality risk. There is now a large evi-dence base demonstrating that the use of eGFRcr-cys reclas-siﬁes a large proportion of the population into differe
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	a large proportion of the population into different GFR stages and the “new”stages better re ﬂect their risk associa- tions. For that reason, where available, cystatin C should beadded to creatinine for the purpose of estimating GFR forCKD diagnosis and staging.1.1.3 Evaluation of chronicity Practice Point 1.1.3.1: Proof of chronicity (duration of aminimum of 3 months) can be established by: (i)review of past measurements/estimations of GFR; (ii)review of past measurements of albuminuria orprot
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	)review of past measurements of albuminuria orproteinuria and urine microscopic examinations; (iii)imaging ﬁndings such as reduced kidney size and reduction in cortical thickness; (iv)kidney pathological ﬁndings such as ﬁbrosis and atrophy; (v)medical history, especially conditions known tocause or contribute to CKD; (vi)repeat measurements within and beyond the 3-month point. Practice Point 1.1.3.2: Do not assume chronicity basedupon a single abnormal level for eGFR and ACR, as the ﬁnding could
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	normal level for eGFR and ACR, as the ﬁnding could be the result of a recent acute kidney injury (AKI) event or acute kidney disease (AKD). Practice Point 1.1.3.3: Consider initiation of treatments for CKD at ﬁrst presentation of decreased GFR or elevated ACR if CKD is deemed likely due to presence of other clinical indicators. Kidney diseases may be acute or chronic. 1,97We explicitly yet arbitrarily de ﬁne the duration of a minimum of 3 months (>90 days) as delineating “chronic ”kidney disease
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	(>90 days) as delineating “chronic ”kidney disease. The rationale for de ﬁning chronicity is to differentiate CKD from AKDs (such as acute glomerulonephritis [GN]), including AKI, which may require different timelines forinitiation of treatments, different interventions, and have different etiologies and outcomes. The duration of kidney disease may be documented or inferred based on theclinical context. For example, a person with decreased GFRor kidney damage during an acute illness, without pri
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	kidney damage during an acute illness, without priordocumentation of kidney disease, may be inferred to haveAKD. Resolution over days to weeks would con ﬁrm the diagnosis of AKI from a variety of different causes. Aperson with similar ﬁndings in the absence of an acute illness may be inferred to have CKD, and if followed overtime, would be con ﬁrmed to have CKD. In both cases, repeat ascertainment of GFR and kidney damage isrecommended for accurate diagnosis and staging. Thetiming of the evaluat
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	te diagnosis and staging. Thetiming of the evaluation depends on clinical judgment, withearlier evaluation for those suspected of having AKI andlater evaluation for those suspected of having CKD. For people with risk factors for CKD, delaying diag- nosis for the sake of con ﬁrming chronicity can delay care. Many people may not recognize the importance ofa repeat visit if treatment had not been initiated. Thus,initiating treatment both allows for earlier interventionand also indicates to people t
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	earlier interventionand also indicates to people the importance of thedisease.chapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S172 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Newborns who clearly have kidney disease (e.g., severe congenital malformations of the kidney and urinary tract) do not need to wait 3 months to con ﬁrm CKD. 1.1.4 Evaluation of cause Practice Point 1.1.4.1: Establish the cause of CKD usingclinical context, personal and fami

Practice Point 1.1.4.2: Use tests to establish a cause basedon resources available ( Table 6 22,98-100). In evaluation of cause, healthcare providers should select speciﬁc diagnostic tests based on the pretest probability of a speciﬁc diagnosis informed by clinical presentation. Identi ﬁca-
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	is informed by clinical presentation. Identi ﬁca- tion of cause confers bene ﬁt for targeting therapy to slow pro- gression to kidney failure, understanding contributing factors,and prognosis. In addition, identi ﬁcation of cause can help people communicate information about a genetic or familialcause to relatives, improve understanding of their condition in the context of self-care management, and improve health literacy. Genetic testing is emerging as a valuable component for evaluation of cau
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ging as a valuable component for evaluation of cause. In some studies, >10% of people with CKD, regardless of family history, were observed to carry genetic pathogenic and likely pathogenic variant(s) thatrepresent a plausible molecular cause for the development orprogression of CKD. 101–103In some cases, identi ﬁcation of actionable genes through genetic testing can impact the clinical management of people with CKD ( Figure 9100).104,105 The prevalence of genetic causes to CKD is expected to in
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	valence of genetic causes to CKD is expected to increase in future years through increased recognition. A recent KDIGO Controversies Conference listed the following recommendations for when genetic testing can be particularlyinformative: (i) high prevalence of monogenic subtypes within theclinical category, (ii) early age of onset of CKD, (iii) syndromic/multisystem features, (iv) consanguinity, (v) possibility of iden-tifying a condition amenable to targeted treatment, and (vi) CKD/ kidney fail
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	e to targeted treatment, and (vi) CKD/ kidney failure of unknown etiology when kidney biopsy would not be informative due to advanced disease. 100 The KDIGO Controversies Conference also highlighted the importance of an educated workforce with expertise inkidney genetics, genomics, and computational research forappropriate use and interpretation of these tests (Figure10 100). Access to genetic counseling and medical genetics is important for psychosocial support, appropriate use of genetic testi
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	hosocial support, appropriate use of genetic testing, and to limit costs.102 Most people with a new diagnosis of CKD and their healthcare providers would prefer to undertake evaluation for the underlying cause to ensure that the best possible care isprovided. Although some people identi ﬁed as having CKD may prefer not to undergo the (sometimes invasive) pro-cedures to evaluate cause, establishing cause enables the mostappropriate management strategy to be implemented. Resources available for ev

Therefore, healthcare providers should tailor the eval-uation of cause based on these resource constraints (e.g.,urine protein reagent strip testing instead of ACR). Education on the value of establishing a diagnosis of CKD is critical. This can be done through local, national, and in-ternational kidney societies and within healthcare training programs
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	societies and within healthcare training programs (Chapter 5 ). Additional resources may be required to support wider scale implementation of diagnostic tests, especially genetic testing, availability of biopsies, and thesupport required for implementation. Identi ﬁcation of cause is often achieved by standard clin- ical methods (i.e., history and examination), knowledge of thecauses of CKD and their manifestations (i.e., level of GFR andspeciﬁc marker of kidney damage such as hematuria, urine a

Not all evaluations of cause are required in all people. Information from the clinical context and initialtests may lead to further evaluations ( Table 6 ), which are likely to be conducted as part of specialized kidney careservices and dependent on resources (Chapter 5 ). Recommendation 1.1.4.1: We suggest performing a kidney biopsy as an acceptable, safe, diagnostic test to

To optimize bene ﬁt and safety, a standardized approach for kidney biopsy with avetted and standardized operating protocol designed for localimplementation is warranted. Of note, most

Of note, most studies reportedusing ultrasound-guided biopsies and older literature sug-gesting higher bleeding rates were conducted in the absence of guided biopsies; thus, we might infer that there is a po- tential for higher rate of harms in “blind ”/unguided biopsies. Rationale Kidney biopsy is an important part of the investigations forthe cause of CKD. It is often deferred because of the potentialfor harm or lack of recognition of potential utility. The
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	m or lack of recognition of potential utility. The evi-dence to support safety of biopsy is heterogeneous andtherefore uncertain, but in the studies evaluated, appears toconfer low risk of harm, supporting our suggestion thatkidney biopsies should be considered when it is thought thatthey can provide information to identify cause, facilitate prognostication, and inform treatment strategies.

In this section, we describe the overall approach for the evaluation of GFR. A

As in the previous KDIGO ClinicalPractice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management ofChronic Kidney Disease, 1theﬁrst method to evaluate GFR should be eGFRcr. If necessary for greater accuracy, theapproach then recommends subsequent supportive testsfrom either the more accurate eGFRcr-cys or measurementof GFR using urinary or plasma clearance of exogenous ﬁltration markers. In contrast to the previous guideline, we emphasize the use of eGFRcr-c
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	evious guideline, we emphasize the use of eGFRcr-cys based on accumulatingevidence for its greater accuracy across populations and theuse of mGFR given the known residual errors in allestimating equations. We also describe laboratorytechniques and standards that satisfy the requirements forrobust result reporting. We encourage healthcare providersto have a clear understanding of the value and limitations of both ﬁltration markers and mGFR, the importance of standardization of assays for creatini
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	portance of standardization of assays for creatinine and cystatin C, and quality control procedures for exogenous markers. Finally,we describe currently available, validated estimatingequations that can be used for the reporting of GFR byclinical laboratories. 1.2.1 Other functions of kidneys besides GFR Practice Point 1.2.1.1: Use the term “GFR ”when referring to the speci ﬁc kidney function of glomerular ﬁltration. Use the more general term “kidney function(s)” when dealing with the totality o
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	dney function(s)” when dealing with the totality of functions of the kidney. The kidneys play several roles in the body, including metabolism and excretion of substances, volume and BPregulation, erythropoietin production, and regulation ofelectrolytes, acid-base status, and mineral homeostasis.Glomerular ﬁltration is one of many functions of the kidney. GFR is considered the best overall assessment of kidneyfunctions as, in general, losses of these other functions correlate with the loss of GFR
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ese other functions correlate with the loss of GFR. The term “kidney function ” reﬂects the entirety of different and complex physiological functions of the kidney; thus, kidney function should not be a term used interchangeably with GFR. Assessment of the overall functions of the kidney is a complex task. GFR is used as the primary tool to assess kidneyfunction in practice. Loss of other kidney functions areknown as complications of CKD and are addressed in Chapter 3 . This section focuses on h
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	addressed in Chapter 3 . This section focuses on how GFR can be evaluated using both mGFR and eGFR. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. There are numerous kidney dis- orders in children that may present with tubular dysfunction (e.g., Bartter ’s and Dent disease) rather than decreased GFRor albuminuria. These primarily result in polyuria and/orelectrolyte disturbances and may or may not progress toreduced GFR or kidney failure. Thus, the exclusive use of GFRin diagnosing CKD would n
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	the exclusive use of GFRin diagnosing CKD would not be of value in children, high- lighting the importance of appreciating different markers linked to different kidney functions. 1.2.2 Guidance to physicians and other healthcare providers We describe a framework for evaluation of GFR beginningwith an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests(Figure 11 ,Tables 7 and8 127–142). Figure 11 depicts an algorithm for evaluation of GFR from initial test using eGFRcr, followed by decision
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	om initial test using eGFRcr, followed by decisions for when toperform supportive tests such as cystatin C or mGFR(Tables 7 and8). Healthcare providers should consider both potential sources of error in eGFR as well as whether theclinical decision requires a highly accurate GFR whenconsidering the need for additional tests. The level ofaccuracy that is needed for a clinical decision for the use ofpotentially toxic medications, a medication with a narrowtherapeutic window, or for other therapies
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	narrowtherapeutic window, or for other therapies with potentialfor adverse events, may exceed the capability of any eGFRequation, and in such cases, mGFR should be performed. This assessment would ideally be performed every time a GFR value is used to make a clinical decision. Practice Point 1.2.2.1: Use serum creatinine (SCr) and an estimating equation for initial assessment of GFR(Figure 11 ). There are no RCTs to quantify the impact for the use of less accurate methods versus more accurate m
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	se of less accurate methods versus more accurate methods of assessment of GFR. For most clinical circumstances, esti- mating GFR from SCr is appropriate for diagnosis, staging,and monitoring the progression of CKD, and observationaldata documented an increase in CKD recognition and referralto nephrologists shortly after the implementation of reportingof eGFR by clinical laboratories, especially for females andelderly people. 143–145GFR is used in many routine and complex clinical decisions as an

Sources of error in GFR estimation from SCr concentration include non– steady-state conditions, non-GFR determinants of SCr, measurement error at higher GFR, and interferences with the creatinineassays. GFR estimates are less precise at higher GFR levelsthan at lower levels, and healthcare providers should remainaware of caveats for any estimating equation that mayinﬂuence the accuracy in an individual person.chapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S176 K

Minimal cost or resources issues are expected because creatinine is available in healthcare settings globally, and evalu-ating GFR with the use of creatinine in the form of GFR esti-mating equations has been

Attention is required to implement and ensure the quality of eGFR reporting byclinical laboratories and ensure coordination with the elec-tronic medical record (EMR), including those eGFR reports from point-of-care settings (Section 1.2.2 ).Recommendation 1.2.2.1: We recommend using eGFRcr-cys in clinical situations when eGFRcr is lessaccurate and GFR affects clinical decision-making
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	saccurate and GFR affects clinical decision-making (Table 8 127-142)(1C). This recommendation places a high value on using estimates of GFR derived from a combination of creatinine and cystatin C in clinical situations where eGFRcr is an unreliable or inadequateassessment of GFR.

Importantly, evenfor people from populations where eGFRcr-cys has beendemonst

Reagent costs are currently more expensive thancreatinine but are lower compared with other commonly usedbiomarkers.

Ideally, these decreaseover time with increased utilization. Considerations for implementation. We recognize that for these recommendations to be implemented, cystatin C needsto be widely available. Wherever possible, access to bothcreatinine and cystatin C measurements should be madeavailable when evaluating GFR. Education for healthcare providers and people with CKD

See Section 1.2.3 for details regarding the measurement of creatinine and cystatin C byclinical laboratories.Rationale We describe a framework for the evaluation of GFR beginningwith an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests(Figure 11 ,Table 7 ). Cystatin C is an alternative endogenous ﬁltration marker that is now increasingly available. Its assay can be put on au
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	increasingly available. Its assay can be put on autoanalyzers, and therefore its utilization couldbe increased with clinical demand. eGFRcr-cys provides the most accurate estimate and is recommended as the primary supportive test for people in whom there are concerns abouteGFRcr accuracy ( Table 8 127–142). However, there remain residual errors with some groups of people having a very highlevel of errors. In such people, we advocate using mGFR. Weanticipate that such considerations be made at ev
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	eanticipate that such considerations be made at every encounterwhere GFR is being used for a clinical decision. Practice Point 1.2.2.2: Where more accurate ascertainment of GFR will impact treatment decisions, measure GFR usingplasma or urinary clearance of an exogenous ﬁltration marker ( Table 9). Given the bene ﬁt of accurate assessment of GFR for clin- ical decision-making, there is a need to appreciate the valueand circumstances in which directly mGFR is required. Thegreatest bene ﬁt of mGFR
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ctly mGFR is required. Thegreatest bene ﬁt of mGFR is that it is less in ﬂuenced by non- GFR determinants, in contrast to eGFR. GFR is measuredusing exogenous ﬁltration markers and urinary or plasma clearance. The precision of mGFR can be determined from variability with repeated measures. Time-to-time variability is the method used to assess error. One systematic review summarizing the available data comparing current GFR measurement methods to each otherand to the classic gold standard of inul

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	FRcys, and eGFRcr-cys were approximately 5.0%. 169Other studies have observed CV for this same mGFR method ranging fromapproximately 5% to 10%. 169,170There are less data for other methods; for urinary clearance of iothalamate,estimated CVs were 6.3% and 16.6% across 2 studies. 171–173 The Work Group judged that there will be some clinical situations where estimating GFR from both creatinine andcystatin C will be insuf ﬁciently reliable or precise, and the greatest bene ﬁt and least harm will be
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	e, and the greatest bene ﬁt and least harm will be achieved by measuring GFR with the appropriate standardized methods. Costs for mGFR are variable and harder to quantify. The infrastructure required is greater, as testing requires bothpatient and personnel time for inserting a peripheral intra-venous catheter, administering the exogenous marker, col-lecting serial blood specimens over several hours (dependingon the protocol), and the associated materials for the collection and measuring blood l
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	materials for the collection and measuring blood levels by high-performance liquid chromatography or mass spectrometry. Utilization ofmGFR may require input from a nephrologist in some set-tings, which would also add to the costs of testing. All nephrologists ideally should therefore have access to at least 1 method to measure GFRusing plasma or urinary clearanceof exogenous markers. T o ensure highly accurate measurements,these clearance methods should be performed using standard operating proc
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	should be performed using standard operating procedures. External quality assessment (EQA) should be used for assays of the exogenous markers. Special consider-ations in clearance methods are required for some populations toobtain a high level of accuracy (e.g., later sampling time forpeople with low GFR or urinary, instead of plasma clearance foredematous people). GFR centers, under the direction of anephrologist champion or laboratory director, analogous tocardiac imaging, are likely to help
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	, analogous tocardiac imaging, are likely to help both increase utilization and ensure high quality results. There will be additional requirements for storage, administration, and disposal if radionuclide meth-odologies are adopted.

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ne is currently harmonizing mGFR protocols for iohexol plasma clearance to deliver standardized operating procedures for GFR measurements in the near future. Decisions to measure GFR should be made by both ne- phrologists and other physicians using the framework sug-gested in Figure 11 . Physicians should determine how accurate the GFR needs to be for a speci ﬁc clinical decision. If greater accuracy is needed than can be achieved using eGFR, mGFRis recommended. Greater accuracy may be required
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	Ris recommended. Greater accuracy may be required due to inaccuracy of eGFR in the individual person due to the presence of non-GFR determinants or due to the requirementof the clinical setting. Table 10 lists indications for when one might consider mGFR as opposed to eGFRcr-cys. We describe a framework for the evaluation of GFR beginning with an initial test and followed by additional supportive tests(Figure 11 ,Table 7 ). mGFR is recommended when there are concerns about the accuracy of eGFRcr
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	en there are concerns about the accuracy of eGFRcr-cys ( Table 8 127-142)o r where an accurate level of GFR is required for optimaldecision-making, as described in Table 10 . Practice Point 1.2.2.3: Understand the value and limitationsin both eGFR and measured glomerular ﬁltration rate (mGFR) as well as the variability and factors that in ﬂuence SCr and cystatin C measurements. All studies evaluating the performance of eGFR compared with mGFR observe error in any GFR estimate. Even inpopulations
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	erve error in any GFR estimate. Even inpopulations where there is a high accuracy (i.e., P 30of 90%), 10% of the population would have errors $30% relative to mGFR. Within these studies, error rates are likely to be higherin some subgroups and lower in others. A critical componentof the recommended approach to evaluation of GFR ( Figure 11) is that physicians have a clear understanding of the value and limitations of eGFR and mGFR, which de ﬁnes when a person requires one or another supportive t
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	when a person requires one or another supportive test. The source of error in eGFR may be related to errors in eGFR or in mGFR ( Figure 12 174). The most important sources of error are non-GFR determinants of either creatinine or cystatin C. Thenon-GFR determinants of creatinine include generation by dietand muscle mass, tubular secretion, and extrarenalelimination. 130,175The non-GFR determinants of cystatin C are less well understood but thought to be higher adiposity, smoking, hypo- and hyper

Errors may be related to analytical errors in the assay or the clearance p
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	analytical errors in the assay or the clearance procedure. For example, the overestimation of GFR is seen if late samples are not taken for people with low GFR.167,186Urinary clearances are preferred to plasma clearance methods in people withextensive third spacing of ﬂuid. 169–173In the absence of changes related to disease progression, a change in mGFRfrom time to time may occur due to preanalytical (e.g.,patient preparation and time of day), analytical (laboratorymeasurement variability), an
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	analytical (laboratorymeasurement variability), and biological (changes in true physiological GFR) variability, as is the case for eGFR. This does not detract from the advantage of mGFR as being freefrom non-GFR determinants. It is important fornephrologists to appreciate and understand these errors andnuances to appropriately order the right tests in speci ﬁc circumstances. Practice Point 1.2.2.4: Interpretation of SCr level requires consideration of dietary intake. Most studies measuring GFR f
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	on of dietary intake. Most studies measuring GFR for clinical or research pur- poses are performed in the morning after a period of fasting or moderate protein intake. Ideally, optimal application of eGFRwould simulate these conditions. Several studies havedocumented the impact of a cooked meat or ﬁsh meal on creatinine concentrations. 187For example, one study demonstrates increase in SCr of approximately 20 mmol/l (0.23 mg/dl) which in the study population was equivalent todecrease in eGFR of
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	y population was equivalent todecrease in eGFR of approximately 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. Maximum postprandial effects were reached in some subjectsby 2 hours and others by 4 hours. Waiting for at least 12hours before the measurement of SCr, after meat or ﬁsh intake, best avoids this effect. We recognize that this approachmay be challenging to implement in the clinical environment. Practice Point 1.2.2.5: Assess the potential for error in eGFR when assessing a change in GFR over time. When evaluat
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	assessing a change in GFR over time. When evaluating a change in eGFR over time, the question is whether the true GFR is changing. However as describedabove, there are several other potential causes for a change inobserved eGFR, other than AKI, such as changes in non-GFRdeterminants of the ﬁltration markers or analytical errors in the assays. Healthcare providers should consider whether there has been a change in non-GFR determinants (e.g., a recent meat meal now or at the ﬁrst measurement or c

It is important to determine how accurate the assessment of GFR needs to be for clinical decision-making. P 30for eGFR refers to the percent of eGFRs that are within 30% of mGFR. If accuracy within 30% is acceptable (P 30>80%) or optimal (P 30>90%), eGFR may be suf ﬁcie
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	0>80%) or optimal (P 30>90%), eGFR may be suf ﬁcient, provided that there are not large deviations in non-GFR determinants of creatinine or cystatin C. If greater accuracy is needed, mGFR is advised. The accuracy for mGFR is based on time-to-time variability. P 15for mGFR refers to the percent of one mGFR that was within 15% of the second. At a GFR of 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 30% accuracy for eGFR corresponds to 42 to 78 ml/min per 1.73 m2and 15% accuracy for mGFR corresponds to 51 to 69 ml/min pe

At a GFR of 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 30% accuracy for eGFR corresponds to 21 to 39 ml/min per 1.73 m2and 15% accuracy for mGFR corresponds to 26 to 35 ml/min per 1.73 m2.

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ct of changes in biological and analytical variationshould be considered as part of the interpretation of the re-sults ( Figure 12 174).169 Practice Point 1.2.2.6: Consider the use of cystatin C –based estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFRcys) in some speciﬁc circumstances. The combination of eGFRcr and eGFRcys together is more accurate than eGFRcr or eGFRcys alone.91,147The greater accuracy is due to the fact that the non-GFR determinantsfor each marker are different, and therefore using bo
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	each marker are different, and therefore using both leads to convergence on the estimate of GFR and minimizes the effect of either marker. 188 In individuals where non-GFR determinants of creatinine or cystatin C are substantially greater than for the othermarker, eGFRcr-cys would not provide the more accurateestimate. This imbalance is more likely to occur for creati-nine, given its association with diet and muscle mass, whichcan vary greatly across various people. In such cases, it would be r
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	cross various people. In such cases, it would be reasonable to use eGFRcys. The non-GFR determinants for cystatin C are less well studied, and it is erroneous to assume that eGFRcys provides the more accurate estimate in all circumstances. We, there-fore, advise limiting this strategy to selected clinical settingswhere people are otherwise healthy with known changes innon-GFR determinants of creatinine. For example, in 1 studythat compared eGFRcr and eGFRcys before and after ampu- tation in othe
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	and eGFRcys before and after ampu- tation in otherwise healthy military veterans, there was a sizable change in eGFRcr as would be expected with the lossof a limb and loss of mobility, but no change in eGFRcys. 128 In another study of people with anorexia, serum levels ofcystatin C were more strongly correlated with mGFR thanwere levels of SCr, but this has not been further evaluatedusing eGFR and standardized assays. 127Other situations may be where there are medications that inhibit tubular s
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	where there are medications that inhibit tubular secretion of creatinine, although there are no studies to provide evidence to drive guidance. Practice Point 1.2.2.7: Understand the implications of dif- ferences between eGFRcr and eGFRcys, as these may beinformative, in both direction and magnitude of thosedifferences. For people who have simultaneous SCr and cystatin C values, the agreement or discrepancy between eGFRcr andeGFRcys may help to guide further actions. Several studieshave demonstra
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ide further actions. Several studieshave demonstrated that 25% –30% of people have discordance between eGFRcr and eGFRcys as large as or larger than 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2or$20%.82,138,189One study demonstrated that factors associated with higher values for eGFRcrcompared with eGFRcys included older age, female sex,non–Black race, higher eGFR, higher BMI, weight loss, and current smoking. 190Two recent studies demonstrate that when there is concordance between eGFRcr and eGFRcys,there is high an
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	rdance between eGFRcr and eGFRcys,there is high and similar accuracy for eGFRcr, eGFRcys, andeGFRcr-cys with estimated P 30of 87% –91%.82,138,189Incontrast, when there is discordance, eGFRcr-cys is moreaccurate than either eGFRcr or eGFRcys. This suggests thatwhen eGFRcr and eGFRcys are discordant, it is reasonableto continue to measure cystatin C serially in addition to creatinine in those settings where GFR will affect clinical decisions. It is also reasonable to consider performing/conducting
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	also reasonable to consider performing/conducting mGFR when using medications with narrowtherapeutic index or high toxicity or to inform criticaltreatment decisions (Chapter 4 ). Practice Point 1.2.2.8: Consider timed urine collections formeasured creatinine clearance if mGFR is not available and eGFRcr-cys is thought to be inaccurate. mGFR is not available everywhere. In these settings, it might be reasonable to consider measured urinary creatinine clearance (CrCl). It is widely available and
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	nine clearance (CrCl). It is widely available and thereforecommonly used but is highly prone to error due to under- orovercollection. A systematic review of GFR methods observeda mean bias of 25% across 23 studies, and as such, did notﬁnd this method to reach suf ﬁcient accuracy. 166The errors occur in both directions and thus do not appear solely dueto the presence of tubular secretion of creatinine, whichwould be expected to overestimate mGFR.

This method also reactswith a variety of substances that are not creatinine (so-called“non-creatinine chromogens, ”e.g., glucose and acetoacetate),typically comprising some 20% of the measured substancereported as creatinine in adults at physiological creatinineconcentrations. Enzymatic assays are available that are morespeciﬁc for creatinine and less susceptible to chemical and chromogenic

As described in Section 1.2, eGFR is an imperfect estimate of mGFR. At best, 90% of eGFR will fall within 30% ofmGFR. As shown in Figure 12 , one of the sources of error is analyt
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	Figure 12 , one of the sources of error is analytical variability in measurement of the ﬁltration markers. Optimization of laboratory measurements ofcreatinine and cystatin C can help to reduce the uncertaintyinherent in GFR estimation. The components ofmeasurement error that laboratories must address areaccuracy (trueness of the result), imprecision (analytical variability of the result, commonly expressed as a CV), and speciﬁcity (reduction of interferences in the measurement). The availabili

The availability of international reference standards for bothcreatinine 220and cystatin C221and demonstration that the laboratory results have minimal bias compared with thesehelp to ensure the accuracy of results. Imprecision targetsare commonly based on the known biological variability ofbiomarkers (https://biologicalvariation.eu/ ). Analytical variability that is less than half the within-person biologicalvariability is generally considered desirable. 222T
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ariability is generally considered desirable. 222The target CVs proposed here for creatinine and cystatin C should beachievable by automated laboratory methods. Achieving thetarget precision and bias goals proposed will ensure thatlaboratory error contributes to a less than 10% increase inroot mean square error when estimating GFR. 205 Most people with CKD, healthcare providers, and policy makers would want laboratories to implement calibrated as-says for creatinine and cystatin C that comply wi

Compliancewith the recommended standards would ensure con ﬁdence in the results and in clinical decisions and any changes inmanagement and treatment made as a consequence. Globally, most GFR estimates are currently produced using creatinine results generated by Jaffe assays, which are rela-tively inexpensive. Use of more speci ﬁc
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	are rela-tively inexpensive. Use of more speci ﬁc enzymatic creatinine assays can improve the estimation of GFR. However, enzy-matic creatinine assays are more expensive than Jaffe assays.Use of cystatin C in combined creatinine-cystatin C GFRequations can also further improve GFR estimation, butcystatin C measurement adds signi ﬁcantly to the cost. Although the per-patient cost increase of enzymatic creatinine and cystatin C measurement is relatively small, the imple- mentation of these more e

Implementation considerations include the following: Creatinine.

To aid clarity in reporting across and within healthcare systems, and to provide guidance regarding the number ofmeaningful digits in a result, a standardized approach in relation to reporting units of GFR, creatinine, and cystatin C should be implemented. Input age may be rounded to wholenumbers or as a fractional year because the in ﬂuence on eGFR is

To adjust GFR for differences in body size,mGFR is commonly adjusted for body surface area (BSA),with a population average BSA value of 1.73 m 2being used. In practice, eGFR values derived using most equations arealready adjusted for BSA, because BSA was taken into account when the equations were originally developed using regres- sion modeling against BSA-adjusted mGFR. eGFR is mostly computed using the information recorded in the sex va
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	puted using the information recorded in the sex variable in EMRs. Some EMRs include legal sex, sexassigned at birth, and gender identity, whereas others includeonly one variable. In some cases, this variable may be missingor reported as nonbinary. In these cases, eGFR values cannotbe computed and will be displayed as a missing value.

In children and adolescents, a reduced GFR is likely to deteriorate further and, therefore, warrants closer monitoringand early intervention. Children with lower-than-normal GFRoften experience deterioration in GFR during periods of rapidgrowth in adolescence. 224Those with subnormal GFR during adolescence are more likely to eventual

Even mild decreases ineGFR (i.e., CKD G2) are associated with poor kidneyoutcomes. In a US study of over 7 million children captured by electronic health record data, 8600 had CKD G2. At 10 years from cohort entry, the rate of reaching kidney failureor a 50% decline in eGFR ranged from around 10%(nonglomerular CKD) to around 40% (glomerular CKD). 225 Furthermore, eGFR between 60 and 90 ml/m

Practice Point 1.2.4.1: Use the same equation within geographical regions (as de ﬁned locally [e.g., continent, country, and region] and as large as possible). Within such regions, equations may differ for adults and children. The recommendation places a high value on the use of an estimating equation for GFR that has been validated in the population of interest and which has been shown to be most accurate in comparison with mGFR and a low value on the comparison of performa
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	mGFR and a low value on the comparison of performance characteristics across differentequations. The key points are to use an equation validated inand most suited to the population of interest. Key information Balance of bene ﬁts and harms.

The intention of suggesting the use of the sameequation within a region is to reduce clinical confusion ifpeople with CKD go to different laboratories within a regionand to enable appropriate population comparisons. Use ofdifferent equations (and thus different eGFR values for thesame person) may lead to confusion for both the individualperson and their healthcare providers.

The criteria were developed by accumulated evidence from assessment of the performance of eGFR versus mGFR acrossequations and populations.

The WorkGroup recognizes that different values and preferences maylead to different decisions in selection among validated GFR estimating equati

Thus, instead of being prescriptive, we list a set of criteria that de ﬁnes a valid equation, a set of equations considered valid at this time, and a list of metrics todeﬁne better versus worse performance as evaluated in the local area. It is of value that GFR thresholds for de ﬁnition and staging be standardized using valid equations optimized for aspeciﬁc region helps to ensure this occurs.

Since thepublication of the KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guidelinefor the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Dis-ease 1for GFR estimation in adults, there have been 3 main sources of validated equations: those developed by theCKD-EPI, those developed by EKFC, and modi ﬁcations of each for use in speci ﬁc regions ( Table 14 83,91,147,148,235,238– 243).Table 15 lists th

The CKD-EPI Research Group developed equations for estimating GFR from creatinine, cystatin C, and the combinationof both, with and without inclusion of a coef ﬁcient for Black race.

TheEKFC developed equations for estimating GFR from creatinineand cystatin C. 91,240Before implementation in other regions, the authors recommended that local regions specify population-speci ﬁc Q-values for the creatinine-based EKFC equation, which is the no

T o make the SCr-based EKFC equation applicable for children,age-adjusted Q-values were de ﬁned. The original EKFCcreatinine equation had a Q-value developed from Belgiumand Sweden but was validated in 7 European studies and isrecommended for use in White Europeans. 240They have recently published Q-values for Black Europeans developed from a cohort of 90 kidney donors in Paris and for Black Africans devel

The EKFC cystatin C equation includes only age and cystatin C, that is, it does notinclude sex or race. The Q-value for cystatin C was developedin a White cohort in Uppsala, Sweden. The cystatin C –based EKFC equation has been validated in White Europeans, BlackEuropeans, White Americans, and Black Africans. T o increase accuracy and precision, EKFC recommends averaging creati
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	cy and precision, EKFC recommends averaging creatinine and cystatin C to obtain an estimate of GFR thatincludes both ﬁltration markers. eGFRcr-cys (the average of the EKFC creatinine and EKFC cystatin C) also provides themost accurate estimates, consistent with the ﬁndings of CKD- EPI eGFRcr-cys. In both the CKD-EPI and EKFC external validation data- sets, there are consistent ﬁndings that the eGFRcr-cys provides improved performance in estimating mGFR compared withthe respective creatinine- or

This re-inforces the recommendation in Section 1.2.1 emphasizing the greater use of eGFRcr-cys for decisions that require GFR. There have been several modi ﬁcations to the CKD-EPI equations for use in individual countries, including China, Japan,and Pakistan. 83,153,235We expect country-speci ﬁcm o d i ﬁcations of both CKD-EPI and EKFC to continue to be developed.

Direct comparisons of available estimating equations in populationswith worldwide applicability are lacking, and so too arevalidation studies comparing equations against mGFR in allpopulations of interest. The overall certainty of the evidence is therefore low but where the performance characteri

Practice Point 1.2.4.2: Use of race in the computation of eGFR should be avoided. Estimating equations for GFR have historically incorpo- rated demographic variables of age, sex, and race to explainvariation in serum concentrations of endogenous ﬁltration markers that are u

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	cultural, and sociopolitical forces,and thus the de ﬁnition can change across geography and over time. 246,247Consistent with this, in the past several years, inclusion of race in GFR estimating equations, along withother algorithms in medicine, faced increasing scrutiny,particularly in the United States but also elsewhere in theworld. 248–254Concerns included, ﬁrst, race is a social and not a biological construct, and thus the de ﬁnition of a race group is subject to change over time. Second,
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ace group is subject to change over time. Second, using a binary variable toassign race groups ignores social and biological diversity withinand among people with similar racial background groups.Third, there are differences across countries and regions inself-reported race and ethnicity, thus leading to uncertainty asto how to apply the term, and blanket use can lead to error. Thus, even though the inclusion of an indicator for race group leads to improved accuracy compared with mGFR in some st
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	to improved accuracy compared with mGFR in some studies, these concerns and other considerations led to the 2021 recommendation for it not to be used in the computationof eGFR in the United States. 255Other countries have also recognized that race should not be included in computationand elected to use the CKD-EPI 2009 age, sex, race –non- Black, as the population of people who are Black wassufﬁciently small to not warrant error for other groups. 236,256 We recognize that speci ﬁc countries or r

Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 1.2.4.3: Estimate GFR in children usingvalidated equations that have been developed or validatedin comparable populations.Examples of validated equations include the CKiD under 25 years old (U25) 2021 eGFRcr equation, the EKFC, and t

The Work Group judged that many healthcareproviders would choose the CKiD U25 2021 eGFRcr equation given it was derived in a multiracial cohort of children with CKD and has been externally validated in cohorts with reducedand normal GFR. The performance of the CKiD U25 2021eGFRcr equation is uncertain in the very young, those with verylow GFR, or in populations outside of Europe and NorthAmerica. 257An alternative height/sex/age/crea

The EKFC equation has been validated in a large cohort of European children (N ¼1254), as well as in adults.240Of interest, the EKFC equation in children is the same as in adults. Thus, bothCKiD U25 and EKFC allow a GFR estimation for childrenwith CKD without changes in ca

Inchildren with neurological disorders, muscle wasting, or who have metabolic disorders and are on a very low –protein diet, a cystatin C –based equation is likely more appropriate. 1.3 Evaluation of albuminuria Albuminuria refers to abnormal loss of albumin in the urine (urine ACR $30 mg/g or $3 mg/mmol). Albumin is one type of plasma protein found in the urine in normal sub
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	of plasma protein found in the urine in normal subjects andin larger quantity in people with kidney disease. In the KDIGO2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation andManagement of Chronic Kidney Disease, 1clinical terminology was changed to focus on albuminuria rather than proteinuriaas albumin is the principal component of urinary protein in most kidney diseases. Epidemiologic data demonstrate a strong relationship between the quantity of urine albumin with bothkidney and CVD risk and
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	of urine albumin with bothkidney and CVD risk and observed CVD even at very lowlevels, and assays to measure albumin are more precise andsensitive than assays to measure urine protein. We refer toalbuminuria or urine albumin when discussing generalconcepts and will refer either to total protein, albumin, or otherspeciﬁc proteins when discussing that parameter speci ﬁcally. 1.3.1 Guidance for physicians and other healthcare providers Practice Point 1.3.1.1: Use the following measurements for ini

Practice Point 1.3.1.3: Understand factors that may affectinterpretation of measurements of urine albumin andurine creatinine and order con ﬁrmatory tests as indicated (Table 16 ). The practice point advocating for the use of spot samples measuring albumin or protein greatly facilitates its incorpo-ration into clinical practice by avoiding the need for timedurine collections. Such spot sam
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	the need for timedurine collections. Such spot samples can over- or underesti-mate urine albumin due to variation in dilution. Use of ACRor protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) in spot urine samplescan decrease this error. ACR is an estimate of total urine al-bumin loss. The creatinine excretion rate varies substantially between people. ACR or PCR will overestimate urine albumin loss in people with low creatinine excretion and will under-estimate urine albumin or protein loss in people with veryhig
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ine albumin or protein loss in people with veryhigh creatinine excretion. The decision by prior guideline Work Groups not to have a sex-speci ﬁc threshold and to use easy-to-remember values regardless of units may also lead to some misclassi ﬁcation. On balance, the current Work Group agrees with this approach given the continued underutilization of urine albumin in the assessment of CKD. It is possible that replacing urinary total protein measure- ment with albumin measurement may cause nonalbu

The signi ﬁcance of this issue is thought to be low in adults. 258–261 In health, relatively small amounts of albumin (< 30 mg/24 hours) are lost in the urine. Urine albumin measurementprovides a more speci ﬁc and sensitive measure of changes in glomerular permeability than urinary total protein. 262–264 There is evidence that urinary albumin is a more sensitive testto enabl

However, timed samples are often collected with error. Overnight, ﬁrst void in the morning, second void in the morning, or random sample collections are therefore rec-ommended as ﬁrst-line tests. 281,282Because creatinine excretion in the urine is fairly con

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	role in settings where access to laboratory services may be limited(see Section 1.4). Implementation of ﬁrst morning voids will be dif ﬁcult to obtain in most healthcare settings. Nephrology of ﬁces could develop protocols to send people with CKD home with aurine collection container and instruction on how to obtain aclean catch, which the person brings back before their nextvisit. Alternatively, obtaining blood and urine tests before the next visit can facilitate ﬁrst morning voids. However, i
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	isit can facilitate ﬁrst morning voids. However, in the absence of a ﬁrst morning void, a random sample may still be used. Negative ﬁndings in people at high risk for CKD, for example, where the urine sample is diluted, can be con ﬁrmed with a subsequent ﬁrst morning void. Positive ﬁndings in people at low risk for CKD, where the ACR level is just above the threshold where the urine samples are concentrated, canalso be con ﬁrmed with a ﬁrst morning void. The numeric equivalence of ACR in mg/g (m

The numeric equivalence of ACR in mg/g (mg/mmol) to approximately g/d is based on the simple assumption thatcreatinine excretion rate (CER) approximates 1 gram/d (10mmol/d). T o better estimate urine albumin in individuals withcreatinine generation that is very different from the average, onemight consider measuring a timed urine collection if the valuewould affect clinical decisions. As with assessment of GFR usingmeasured CrCl, use supervised urine collections. Alternatively, equation
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ervised urine collections. Alternatively, equations are available that estimate creatinine generation from prediction equations and then multiply that value by the ACR tocompute an estimated albumin excretion rate (AER) that ac-commodates the lower or higher level of CER. 299,300 Measurement of urinary albumin is recommended because it is relatively standardized and because it is the single mostimportant protein lost in the urine in most CKDs. Use ofurinary albumin measurement as the preferred t
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	e ofurinary albumin measurement as the preferred test for pro- teinuria detection will improve the sensitivity, quality, and consistency of approach to the early detection and manage-ment of kidney disease. Commonly used reagent strip devices measuring total protein are insuf ﬁciently sensitive for the reliable detection of proteinuria, do not adjust for urinary concentration, and areonly semiquantitative. Furthermore, there is no standardizationbetween manufacturers. The use of such strips shou
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	between manufacturers. The use of such strips should be discouraged in favor of quantitative laboratory measurements of albuminuria or proteinuria, or validated point-of-care de-vices for urine albumin/ACR (Section 1.4). When used, reagent strip results should be con ﬁrmed by laboratory testing.Although the reference point remains the accurately timed 24-hour specimen, it is widely accepted that this is a dif ﬁcult procedure to control effectively and that inaccuracies in urinarycollection may c
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	y and that inaccuracies in urinarycollection may contribute to errors in estimation of albumin and/or protein losses. In practice, untimed urine samples are a reasonable ﬁrst test for ascertainment of albuminuria. A ﬁrst morning void sample is preferred because it correlates well with24-hour albumin and/or protein excretion, has relatively lowintraindividual variability, and is required to exclude thediagnosis of orthostatic (postural) proteinuria. A random urinesample is acceptable if no ﬁrst m

The concentration of albumin or protein in a urine sample will be affected by hydration (i.e., how diluted or concentrated a urine sample is), and reporting the albumin or protein to thecreatinine ratio will correct for urinary concentration andreduce intraindividual variability. 205,261,301,302 There is biological and analytical variability in urine albu- min and urine protein loss. There are several biological f
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	urine protein loss. There are several biological factorsthat affect urine albumin or protein loss, separate from kidneydisease ( Table 16 ). 259All of these can lead to false detection of CKD or its progression. Thus, positive tests should beconﬁrmed, especially in people without risk factors for CKD. Large changes would be repeated to con ﬁrm increasing urine albumin and urine protein. Chapter 2 discusses themagnitude of change to be considered a real change given theknown biological and analyt
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	a real change given theknown biological and analytical variability. There is also biological variability in urine creatinine excretion. Change in creatinine concentration in the urine can also lead to observed changes in ACR or PCR, independently of changes in protein loss. In general, urine creatinine mea-surements are less susceptible to factors that interfere withSCr assays. If a more accurate quanti ﬁcation of albuminuria or total proteinuria is required, measure urine albumin ortotal protei

Special considerations Pediatric considerations.

The same considerations of using ﬁrst morning samples (because of orthostatic proteinuria) and considering tran-siently increased proteinuria during intercurrent illness orafter exercise apply to children as well as adults. Orthostaticproteinuria is estimated to affect 2% –5% of adolescents. 305 Age and body size are important for interpreting proteinuria and albuminuria. In term and preterm neonates, PCR is high(PCR 1000 –3000 m

Recent studies outline proteinuriaranges for neonates, including for preterm and low-birth-weightneonates. As the tubules mature, proteinuria slowly declines.

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	e laboratoryassessment of albuminuria, rather than total proteinuria, givenalbumin measurement is the preferred approach to proteinuriaevaluation (Section 1.3.1. ) However, some of these practice points (sample type and storage, reporting as a PCR) would apply equally to total protein measurement practices.

Practice Point 1.3.2.2: Implementation of an external quality assessment scheme/program for urine albumin and creatinine, including calculation of the ACR, is a preferredpractice for laboratories. Adoption of the reporting and handling standards for assessment of urine samples is of paramount importance toensure that healthcare providers receive urine ACR reports ina consistent style and with assurance regarding the accuracyand reliability of the result.
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	garding the accuracyand reliability of the result. Measurement of urine albumin for the detection of kidney disease as with any analyte should be with methodologytraceable to international standards using a standard referencematerial. This is currently not the case, and results may varyby greater than 40% between laboratories depending on themethodology used with attendant impact on the interpreta-tion of reported results. The type of urine collection and the analytical method inﬂuence result in
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ction and the analytical method inﬂuence result interpretation. Twenty-four-hour urine col- lections present problems in terms of completeness ofcollection, specimen storage, and timing accuracy. Therefore,the assessment of ACR from a single void is a common andconvenient clinical practice. The ACR accounts for hydrationand has similar diagnostic performance to 24-hour urineAER. The collection method should remain consistent, pref-erably using the ﬁrst morning void specimen. If specimens are bei

If specimens are being stored for future analysis, careful attention must be paid to the storage conditions to avoiddegradation of albumin leading to quanti ﬁcation error. The re- ported effects of frozen storage on urine albumin are somewhatinconsistent. Albumin is generally stable in urine stored at 2 /C14C–8 /C14C for 7 days. However, losses of albumin have been reported when urine is stored frozen at temperatures higher than /C080/C14C. Precipitates often form w
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	higher than /C080/C14C. Precipitates often form when urine is stored refrigerated orfrozen but can be redissolved on warming: samples should be warmed to room temperature and mixed before analysis. 290 Albumin losses may be affected by factors including period of storage, sample albumin concentration, and individualvariation. 311It should be possible to provide refrigerated storage and process samples for albumin measurement in alaboratory within 7 days in most healthcare settings. The internat

The internationally accepted laboratory quality standards are variably met worldwide, and laboratories are at different levels with respect to quality. However, the Work Group placed a high value on the accuracy and reliability of quanti ﬁcation of albuminuria and judged that people with CKD, their healthcareproviders, and policy makers would want laboratories to ach-ieve these reporting and handling standards. The direct costs of total protein measurement i
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	s. The direct costs of total protein measurement in urine are lower than those of urine albumin. However, total proteinmeasurement lacks sensitivity for the detection of low but clinically signi ﬁcant levels of albuminuria. For this, and other reasons discussed in Section 1.3.1 , the measurement of ACR is preferred to that of PCR. Urine albumin should be measured using immunological assays capable of speci ﬁcally and precisely quantifying albu- min at low concentrations and of producing quantita
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	in at low concentrations and of producing quantitative re- sults over the clinically relevant range. The biologicalvariation of urine albumin exceeds 60%. Target analytical variation (CV) should be based on an optimal level of <0.25 biological variation, approximately 15%. This is in keeping with good practice recommendations from the NationalAcademy of Clinical Biochemistry. 312Table 17 | Implementation standards to ensure accuracy and reliability of urine samples /C15Samples for albumin measur

Urine albumin (and protein) concentrations in urine should be reported as a ratio to creatinine —ACR (or PCR). Reporting as a ratio to creatinine corrects for variations inurinary ﬂow rate and enables reporting on untimed, spot samples, obviating the need for timed, including 24-hour,collections, which are prone to collection error and tediousfor people to undertake. Reporting albumin as
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	diousfor people to undertake. Reporting albumin as a ratio tocreatinine reduces the intraindividual variability in albumin-uria compared with reporting as albumin concentration alone(mg/mmol or mg/g). 315 To aid clarity in reporting across and within healthcare systems, and to provide guidance regarding the number of meaningful digits in a result, a standardized approach should be used in relation to reporting units of ACR and PCR. ACRresults should be expressed to one decimal place (mg/mmol)or
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	uld be expressed to one decimal place (mg/mmol)or whole numbers (mg/g). Both enzymatic and Jaffe assaysare generally suitable for the measurement of creatinine inurine, although high concentrations of glucose can interferein Jaffe urine creatinine measurement and produce clinicallymeaningful errors in ACR. 1.4 Point-of-care testing Recommendation 1.4.1: We suggest that point-of- care testing (POCT) may be used for creatinine andurine albumin measurement where access to a lab- oratory is limited
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	urement where access to a lab- oratory is limited or providing a test at the point-of- care facilitates the clinical pathway (2C). Practice Point 1.4.1: Whenever a POCT device is used for creatinine and urine albumin testing, ensure that the samepreanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical quality criteriarelating to the specimen collection and performance of thedevice, including external quality assessment, and the interpretation of the result is used. Practice Point 1.4.2: Where a POCT device
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	is used. Practice Point 1.4.2: Where a POCT device for creatinine testing is being used, generate an estimate of GFR. Use theequation consistent with that used within the region. Practice Point 1.4.3: Where a POCT device is being used for albuminuria testing, the capability of also analyzing creatinine and producing an ACR is important. Assess the ability of the POCT ACR devices to produce a positiveresult in 85% of people with signi ﬁcant albuminuria (ACR ‡30 mg/g or ‡3 mg/mmol), as part of the
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	nuria (ACR ‡30 mg/g or ‡3 mg/mmol), as part of the evaluation and consideration of using the device.This recommendation places a high value on the advantages of POCTs including convenience, elimination of sample trans-portation to the central laboratory, minimal sample processing,simple analytic process, minimal sample requirement, and im- mediate availability of results. It places a lower value on the limited and heterogeneous data related to their diagnosticaccuracy. Key information Balance of

POCT may lead to earlier diagnosis, and as a result, earlier treatment ofCKD. They may also be used to monitor CKD progression,which enables more timely treatment decisions. The rapidreporting, low cost, and convenience to people with CKDcompared with central laboratory testing are also important beneﬁts of POCTs. However, its provision can raise cha
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ﬁts of POCTs. However, its provision can raise challenges in relation to maintenance of analytical and diagnostic per- formance, and governance arrangements. In addition, thesetests may be less accurate than laboratory testing, which maylead to misdiagnosis, misclassi ﬁcation, overtreatment, or undertreatment. The balance of bene ﬁts and harms needs rigorous evaluation speci ﬁc to each clinical situation. For creatinine, the ERT identi ﬁed a systematic review from the National Institute for Heal
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ematic review from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellent (NICE)/National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) diagnosticguideline that evaluated point-of-care creatinine tests to assessGFR before computed tomography (CT) scanning withcontrast media. 316The ERT also updated the ﬁndings of this systematic review. The review from NICE/NIHR identi ﬁed and qualitatively synthesized data from 54 studies ondiagnostic accuracy: eGFR diagnostic accuracy (n ¼12), SCr diagnostic accuracy (n
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	stic accuracy (n ¼12), SCr diagnostic accuracy (n ¼7), and correlation and bias of POC creatinine tests compared with laboratory-basedtests (n ¼50). One study 317was identi ﬁed in the update of the NICE/NIHR review assessing POC creatinine testcompared with laboratory standards in a pediatricpopulation with malaria in Uganda. These studies covered 3 types of devices: StatSensor, i- STAT, and ABL devices. In general, all 3 devices demonstrated acceptable accuracy at lower levels of eGFR (< 30 ml/
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	eptable accuracy at lower levels of eGFR (< 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2).316Results showed that i-STAT and ABL devices may have higher probabilities of correctly classifying people in the same eGFR categories as the laboratory reference thanStatSensor devices. For albumin, the ERT identi ﬁed a systematic review pub- lished in 2014, by McTaggart et al. , 318that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative and semiquantitative protein or albumin urine dipstick tests compared with laboratory-based
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	rine dipstick tests compared with laboratory-based tests among people with suspected ordiagnosed CKD. The ERT included relevant studies fromthis review and conducted an update. Sixty- ﬁve studies (in 66 articles) 319–344,345–368,369–384eval- uated the accuracy of quantitative and semiquantitative pro-tein or albumin dipstick tests in a general population not onchapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S194 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 KRT or receiving end-of-life care. Stud
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	S117–S314 KRT or receiving end-of-life care. Studies addressed the following critical outcomes: measurement bias (n ¼1), analytical variability (n ¼5), analytical sensitivity (n ¼2), and analytic speci ﬁcity (n ¼63) (Supplementary Table S5336,347,363,372,373,377,382–384). Speci ﬁcity ranged from 17.5 to 99.5 when evaluative ACR $30 mg/g ($ 3 mg/mmol) and 30.0–98.7 when evaluative ACR $300 mg/g ($ 30 mg/ mmol). For PCR, speci ﬁcity ranged from 80.8 –96.9 when evaluative PCR >200 mg/g (> 20 mg/mm
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	.8 –96.9 when evaluative PCR >200 mg/g (> 20 mg/mmol) and 75.6 –95.2 when evaluative PCR >500 mg/g ( >50 mg/mol). The evidence regarding the performance of POCT for creatinine and urine albumin is heterogeneous limiting the determination of overall ﬁndings across these critical out- comes. However, given the cost-effectiveness bene ﬁts, avail- ability of the test in the absence of laboratory studies, and the acceptable test performance, the Work Group judged that inspeciﬁc clinical scenarios, PO

The certainty of evidence for POCT for creatinine testing was rated as low due to consistentreporting of reference standards across all outcomes, with some concerns regarding patient selection and ﬂow and timing and directness of the evidence. The certainty of evi- dence regarding performance of all POCT for urine albuminwas very low based on the Quality Assessment of DiagnosticAccuracy Studies (QUADAS-2)

Values and preferences. The recommendation suggested that the majority of people with CKD who have limited accessto laboratories would choose to use POCT. These tests mayfacilitate people with CKD being seen at home or in remotesettings. Many people with CKD will value th
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	remotesettings. Many people with CKD will value the immediateresults available with POCT versus waiting for the tests from alab. In addition, some people with CKD will place a highervalue on avoiding expensive lab tests that may not be covered by their insurance, dif ﬁcult travel to central healthcare facil- ities, and exposure to infection risk in hospital. These people with CKD may also place a lower value on the potentialinaccuracies associated with POCTs compared with in-centerlaboratory tes
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	d with POCTs compared with in-centerlaboratory testing. Resource use and costs. For people with CKD, the use of POCTs may be less expensive than tests conducted in aclinical laboratory. In areas with limited access to healthcare and insurance, these tests may be cost saving and increase the detection for CKD. 385,386For the healthcare system, some direct reagent and staff costs of POCT tend to be higher ona per test basis than those of centralized laboratory testing,but these costs may be offset
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	d laboratory testing,but these costs may be offset by other savings in the clinicalpathway, for example, through more rapid disease detectionor avoidance of hospital referral. Considerations for implementation. POCTs may not be available everywhere. Support from the local laboratory ser- vice should be sought to guide the purchase, evaluation, implementation, governance, and ongoing quality assuranceof POCT. The ability to test creatinine in a person ’s home may have applicability to “virtual wa
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	rson ’s home may have applicability to “virtual ward ”settings (hospital at home). It is worth noting that for albuminuria testing, the Na- tional Academy of Clinical Biochemistry has proposed thatdevices should have 95% sensitivity for the detection of albuminuria. 312This is not always achieved by POCT devices, especially those that produce semiquantitative results.318 Rationale POCT can be carried out in a wide range of settings including primary care, community clinics, rural communities, an
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ary care, community clinics, rural communities, andsecondary care supporting timely diagnosis, monitoring, andtreatment. Importantly, in locations where laboratory services may be limited or nonexistent (e.g., rural and remote com- munities), the ability to test versus not testing blood andurine was important. Advantages of POCT include conve-nience, elimination of sample transportation to the centrallaboratory, minimal sample processing because the analysis isof whole blood/urine, simple analyt
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	the analysis isof whole blood/urine, simple analytic process, minimalsample requirement, and immediate availability of results.However, these tests may be prone to errors and inaccuracies. For these reasons, the recommendation suggests the use of these tests based on the speci ﬁc clinical need or geographical/ social circumstances. Use of POCT may facilitate access to earlier diagnosis and, thus, care and can be implemented in rural and remote lo-cations. The value of POCT for currently underser

The POCT devices used would ideally measure both blood creatinine and urine for albumin and creatinine to measure ACR and bestandardized and calibrated with similar rigor as is recom-mended for laboratory tests. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. The ability to use a small sample volume, ﬁngerprick sample as opposed t

Monitoring CKD through the surveillance of albuminuria and GFR serves to update staging for prognosis, identifytiming of intervention strategies, and assess the effectivenessof speci ﬁc treatments. No clear threshold de ﬁnes a clinically relevant change in GFR or albuminuria, as any worseningcould re ﬂect deterioration in kidney health. However, over- interpretation of small changes in these

Education for healthcare pro- viders and people with CKD about the variability of speci ﬁc laboratory measurements in kidney disease is important to facilitate understanding and to mitigate inappropriatechanges in treatment strategies due to nonclinically signi ﬁcant ﬂuctuations in either positive or negative directions. There is an expected

We have chosen to consider the 95% CI of test reproducibility for both eGFR and ACR as an importantfactor for determining thresholds for clinical evaluation.The initial evaluation of an observed change in either eGFRor ACR should be to repeat the test(s) so as to determine ifthe observed change is clinically signi ﬁcant progression of CKD or i

Monitoring of children in the per- ipubescent phase should be undertaken more frequently thanthe CKD stage –based recommended frequency of monitoring as puberty is a period of high risk of progression. 387Reasons for this are incompletely understood, but potentialmechanisms include inability of diseased kidneys to undergothe hypertrophy nee
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	of diseased kidneys to undergothe hypertrophy needed to accompany the rapid somatic growth that characterizes puberty and the negative effect of increased levels of sex steroids. 388A study of over 900 children with CKD due to CAKUT showed a decline thatwas>10 times faster in creatinine-based eGFR after the period of peak growth than before that period. 388The CKiD study (including children with CKD of any cause) showedmore rapid declines in both eGFR (creatinine- and cystatinC–based) and mGFR

Practice Point 2.1.2: Assess albuminuria and GFR more often for individuals at higher risk of CKD progressionwhen measurement will impact therapeutic decisions. Previous guidelines have suggested the routine monitoring of albuminuria and GFR. Prior
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	e routine monitoring of albuminuria and GFR. Prior guidelines have suggestedannual monitoring for those with CKD G1 –G2, every 6 months for those with CKD G3, every 3 months for CKD G4, and every 6 weeks for CKD G5 disease. Given the greater risk of disease progression, those with higher risk of diseaseprogression should undergo more frequent monitoring(Figure 13 29). More frequent monitoring may be indicated in people with changing clinical status, intercurrent events, andafter therapeutic inte

In addition, progression riskmay vary by the etiology of CKD within a speci ﬁc stage based on GFR and albuminuria or proteinuria. Practice Point 2.1.3: For people with CKD, a change in eGFR of >20% on a subsequent test exceeds the expected variability and warrants evaluation. Within-subject variation in measured and eGFR is well described (Figure 12 ). Thus, the ability to distinguish b
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	d (Figure 12 ). Thus, the ability to distinguish between biological and analytical versus pathological variation in themGFR and eGFR is important for healthcare providers and people with CKD. Studies show that intraindividual biological variation in eGFR is similar across eGFRequations: CKD-EPI-creatinine (5.3% [4.5% –6.4%]), CKD- EPI-cystatin C (5.3% [4.5% –6.5%]), and CKD-EPI- creatinine-cystatin C (5.0% [4.3% –6.2%]). The reference change value (RCV) is de ﬁned as the threshold of change that
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	e (RCV) is de ﬁned as the threshold of change that differs from the individual’ s prior value with 95% CI; in a cohort of people with CKD, eGFRcr and eGFRcys had RCVs ranging from 14% –20% in the positive and negative directions. Although attention to progressive loss of eGFR is important, smaller changes in GFR may not be related totrue changes in kidney health, especially if transient andrequire cautious interpretation. Thresholds for CKD progression used in clinical trials and epidemiological
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ession used in clinical trials and epidemiological studies are different than those suggested formonitoring of people with CKD. In research studies, 30% – 40% declines in GFR have been associated with increased riskfor kidney failure, and treatment effects on these endpointshave been associated with changes in risk for kidney failure.Because these are evaluated at the group level, small errors inindividual people with CKD are minimized.chapter 2 www.kidney-international.org S196 Kidney Internati

Acute eGFR decline after intensive BP control has been observed in people with CKD, with reductions of 10% –20% being typical within the ﬁrst 3 months of treatment. These declines in eGFR are hemodynamically mediated, rep
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	declines in eGFR are hemodynamically mediated, represent-ing a response to BP falling below the lower threshold of aperson ’s autoregulatory response. For many, this initial decline in eGFR is transient and will stabilize or resolve overtime, as resetting of the autoregulatory function occurs. Thus,acute rises in SCr (or declines in eGFR) of <20%–30% are expected and do not warrant changes in therapeutic agents, which may be important for cardio- and kidney-protective effects in the long term. T
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	and kidney-protective effects in the long term. This phenomenon is especiallycommon when using ACEi/angiotensin II receptor blockers(ARBs), as they both lower BP and alter arteriolar ﬂow through the glomeruli, and SGLT2i through similar hemo-dynamic mechanisms. Post hoc analyses of trials of SGLT2i treatment in people with diabetes, heart failure, and CKD suggested that participants with>10% initial drop in eGFR have similar eGFR trajectories and kidney bene ﬁts from SGLT2i compared with the“no

A signi ﬁcant drop in eGFR (> 30%) while initiating anti- hypertensive agents, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), or SGLT2i should prompt a review into other causes and war- rants close monitoring. However, healthcare providers s

However, healthcare providers shouldavoid the urge to stop these kidney-protective agents,particularly because these earlier “dips”are typically reversible and not an indication of drug toxicity.

Routine surveillance us-ing ACR or PCR is warranted in higher risk people with CKD,as changes in urine ACR are associated with kidney failure.Speci ﬁcally, in large population studies, a doubling of the ACR within a 2-year duration is associated with an increase inthe risk of progression to kidney failure by 50% –100%. 391,392Albuminuria categories Descriptio

However, the people within a speci ﬁc“cell”on the grid or within an eGFR/ACR category have a wide range of absoluterisks for each of the adverse outcomes of interest. An indi-vidual person ’s risk for each outcome is in ﬂuenced by their underlying etiology of CKD, demographic characteristics,comorbid conditions, and other factors including lifestyle,SES, nutrition, and intercurrent eve

Thus, the RRs shownin the heatmap tables can be crudely interpreted as a multi-plier superimposed upon the aforementioned other charac-teristics. There can be substantial variability and overlap, upto 8000% in the risk of CKD progression or 4000% in the riskof kidney failure, for 2 people in the same heatmap category or CKD stage ( Figure 14 401,402)402; therefore, individual risk prediction using accurate and externally validated risk equat

The corollary to individualizing absolute risks versus RRs is appreciating the absolute versus relative bene ﬁts of disease- modifying therapies. Although the relative bene ﬁts of medi- cations such as SGLT2i may appear similar across subgroups, the actual bene ﬁt on speci ﬁc outcomes is highest among people who have the higher absolute

All of these use routinely collected data fromlabs or EMRs and have been validated in different pop-ulations, both in North America and internationally tovarying degrees. Detailed review of all existing predictionmodels is beyond the scope of this document. The KFRE was developed and initially validated in 8391 adults from 2 Canadian provinces, an

Discrimination was excellent (C-statistic >0.80 in 28/ 30 cohorts), and the use of a calibration factor improvedcalibration for some regions outside of North America; the validation populations now exceed 2 million individuals in more

Given the potential bene ﬁts and utility of
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ings. Given the potential bene ﬁts and utility of knowing the risk of kidney failure, patients and healthcare providers should beencouraged to use these tools.

There are limited butsupportive studies describing the better prediction of outcomes when using r

Potential harms from the use of predictionequations could result from inappropriate use in the settingsof AKI or AKD or in younger individuals with CKD G1 –G2 who may be at high risk of progression but low risk of kidneyfailure in the next 5 years. In these people, more proximaloutcomes such as 40% decline in GFR or lifetime risk were judged

As described above,healthcare providers should be cognizant of the impact ofbiological and analytical variability in albuminuria and eGFRvalues and the subsequent impact on calculation of predictedrisk of kidney failure.

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	To assess the certainty of evidence, the ERTexamined 2 existing systematic reviews addressing thequestion of the ability of risk prediction models to predictkidney failure (see Supplementary Table S6 ). 406,415The 2021 review from NICE in the United Kingdom (UK) assessed thecertainty of evidence for a variety of risk-based equations topredict kidney failure and concluded that there was high-quality evidence to state that the chosen risk predictionequations accurately predict kidney failure. 415T
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	nequations accurately predict kidney failure. 415There was high certainty of the evidence (C-statistics were high, and the CIswere narrow). The Tangri 2013 review did not assess thecertainty of evidence as part of the review (SupplementaryTables S6 –S9 9,85,89,94,96,408,416).406 The Work Group agreed with the NICE assessment and considered evidence from other systematic reviews andrecently published validation studies.

Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that the accurate prediction of kidney failure was of importance topeople with CKD, their families, and healthcare providers,and that most people with CKD would choose to receiveprognostic information about their individual risk of kidney failure as part of routi

For a global guideline, the Work Group focused on prediction equations that were externallyvalidated, had a low risk of bias, and included variables thatwere routinely available in most healthcare settings. Resource use and costs. Most externally validated risk equations for predicting kidney failure use routinely collecteddata including laboratory variables such as eGFR, albumin-uria, and serum albumin, phosphate, calcium, or hemoglo- b

Where possible, laboratories should report the results from a validated riskequation speci ﬁc to the region automatically for individuals with CKD G3 –G5 when the required variables are available. Simpler equations can be implemented and reported whenminimal data are available and more complex equations,requiring additional variables, can be implemented if therequired data are present. The reporting of risk in the laboratory reports and EMRs should be standardized with appropriate guidance
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	should be standardized with appropriate guidance on riskthresholds, when available. Local validation studies can be performed to determine optimal calibration of the speci ﬁc risk prediction equations before implementation. Imple- mentation of risk equations that are externally validated anduse routinely collected data should be prioritized for healthequity and global health considerations. Rationale Risk prediction equations that are externally validated, andlocally calibrated, when possible,
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	validated, andlocally calibrated, when possible, can lead to improvement inthe delivery of CKD care. These equations should be used asthey can further personalize care plans for people with CKDand enable discussions about the bene ﬁts and harms of dis- ease-modifying therapy. This is a strong recommendation, as the Work Group judged that the evidence supporting both the clinical validityand clinical utility of risk prediction equations was suf ﬁciently strong to recommend widespread adoption. T
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ciently strong to recommend widespread adoption. The Work Groupjudged that most externally validated equations rely onroutinely collected data and could therefore be implementedequally in low-resource settings. The Work Group also judgedthat the majority of physicians will be comfortable in calcu-lating the risk of kidney failure and discussing the risk and related treatment decisions with patients and caregivers.

Work from the CKiD group (2015) provides a risk calculator for disease progression, using age, sex, glomerular versus nonglomerular disease, eGFR, hypertensionand laboratory parameters (calculator available at https://www.kidney.org/professionals/kdoqi/gfr_calculatorPedRiskCalc ). 417 Further analyses combining the CKiD data with that from theESCAPE trial (of BP control in CKD progression in children)resulted in a risk calculator that uses diagnosis, eGFR and proteinuria, and ca

There is uncer- tainty around whether sex assigned at birth or gender i

At present, a holistic approachshould be used that takes into account sex assigned at birth,sex hormone milieu, and gender identity with shared deci-sion-making with the person with CKD. Practice Point 2.2.1: A 5-year kidney failure risk of 3% –5% can be used to determine need for nephrology referral in addition to criteria based on eGFR or urine ACR, and otherclinical considerations.

Practice Point 2.2.2: A 2-year kidney failure risk of >10% can be used to determine the timing of multidisciplinary care in addition to eGFR-based criteria and other clinicalconsiderations. People with CKD G4 –G5 are more likely to develop con- current complications of CKD includ
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	o develop con- current complications of CKD including anemia, hyper-kalemia, bone mineral disorders, and/or metabolic acidosisand protein-energy wasting. In addition, they remain at highrisk for adverse events including AKI, emergency departmentvisits, and hospitalizations. As such, in many countries andhealthcare settings, these people may be enrolled in inter-disciplinary care clinics or receive care management resources to reduce morbidity and healthcare costs, and to avoid un- planned dialys
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	healthcare costs, and to avoid un- planned dialysis initiation. A risk threshold risk of >10% over 2 years has been studied and implemented in some jurisdictions in Canada asthe key eligibility criteria for access to interdisciplinary carethat includes a nurse, pharmacist, renal dietitian or accreditednutrition provider, and other allied health support. Thispractice point is based on results from these studies, which demonstrate acceptance and preference of a risk-based criteria by patients and
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	reference of a risk-based criteria by patients and providers. 422Given the costs associated with delivery of care management resources andinterdisciplinary models, risk-based thresholds offer a usefulguide to the selection of the ideal target patient populationto derive most bene ﬁt from the highly specialized team. It is important to note that people with CKD at earlier stagesor those at lower risk of progression may bene ﬁt from an individual allied health resource (e.g., pharmacist ordietitia
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	llied health resource (e.g., pharmacist ordietitian); however, risk-based thresholds provide a guide toidentify people with CKD who bene ﬁt most from an entire multidisciplinary team. Practice Point 2.2.3: A 2-year kidney failure risk threshold of>40% can be used to determine the modality education, timing of preparation for kidney replacement therapy (KRT) including vascular access planning or referral for transplantation, in addition to eGFR-based criteria andother clinical considerations. The
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	sed criteria andother clinical considerations. The appropriate timing for modality education, timing of vascular access planning, or referral for transplantation in aperson with low or declining GFR can be dif ﬁcult to predict. Vascular access planning in all adults with CKD G4 wouldlead to the unnecessary placement of ﬁstulae, whereas waiting until eGFR falls below 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2may lead to inappropriate overuse of central venous catheters at dialysisinitiation. Studies have described t
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	rs at dialysisinitiation. Studies have described the potential utility of risk-based thresholds in planning for dialysis access speci ﬁcallyand found acceptable speci ﬁcity and positive predictive values for the risk-based threshold criteria as compared with eGFRalone. The Work Group noted that the KDOQI vascular ac-cess guideline (2019) currently recommend a risk-based threshold >50% or eGFR <15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2for initiation of vascular access planning, while acknowledging that access to su
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ss planning, while acknowledging that access to surgeons and primary failure to maturationrates may vary by patient and by center. 423 Based on current evidence, a threshold of >40% risk or an eGFR of 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2is acceptable to use for initiating vascular access referral. Lower risk thresholds, suchas>20%, can optimize sensitivity, can be used to initiate modality education, and may be appropriate for presurgicalvascular access planning or referral for transplantation incenters with l
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	g or referral for transplantation incenters with longer wait times. Practice Point 2.2.4: Note that risk prediction equations developed for use in people with CKD G3 –G5, may not be valid for use in those with CKD G1 –G2. The Work Group recognizes that the progression of CKD can occur at all severities, and that in earlier stages of disease(G1–G3), large declines in eGFR can occur in 2- to 5-year time frames without reaching kidney failure (Figure 16 424). Risk prediction models developed in pop

Risk prediction models developed in populations with later stages of CKD are not accurate in CKD G1 –G2, whereas alternative, accurate, externally validated risk predictionequations have been developed for predicting 40% decline ineGFR or kidney failure at all stages of CKD.

Risk prediction models for speci ﬁc etiologies of
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	Risk prediction models for speci ﬁc etiologies of CKD have also been developed, are externally validated, and used inhealthcare settings to guide clinical care. For autosomal domi-nant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), 2 equations can beuseful in determining the longer-term risk of kidney failure andmay guide therapy with tolvaptan— the Mayo Clinic Classi ﬁ- cation tool and the Predicting Renal Outcome in PolycysticKidney Disease (PROPKD) score, 426,427which incorporates genetic data. Of these

In people with IgAN, 2 externally validated prediction tools (clinical or clinical þhistology) have been developed using large international cohort studies. Models that includedthe mesangial hypercellularity (M), endocapillary hyper- cellularity, segmental glomerulosclerosis (S), and tubular at- rophy/interstitial ﬁbrosis (T) (MEST) histological score were

It is important to note that the clinical presentation of IgAN can include rapidly progressive disease, and people with

Recently, the American Heart Association Predicting Risk of CVD EVENTs (PREVENT /C212 , pending) equations were developed in over 6 million US adults aged 30 –79 years without known CVD with outcomes of incident ASCVD and HF (combined and separately).433,434These equations included eGFR in the primary model and included ACR in an add-on model, sothey

Practice Point 2.3.2: For mortality risk prediction to guide discussions about goals of care, use externally validatedmodels that predict all-cause mortality speci ﬁcally devel- oped in the CKD population. People with CKD are at high risk of all-cause mortality, and the competing risk of death can affect clinical decision-making, particularly for older adults with CKD G4, who maysimultaneously

Risk factors associated with CKD progression, CVD, and other CKD complications are highly interrelated, 435and hence so is their management. We use the term “CKD treatment and risk modi ﬁcation ”to encompass the aim of CKD treatment, which is to impart meaningful bene ﬁcial effects on “CKD manifestations” and on “CKD outcomes ” (Figure 17 ). CKD manifestations include symptoms and clinical/laboratory abnormalities associated with CKD, which confer health implicat

These include increasedBP, anemia, dyslipidemia, CKD-mineral and bone disorder(CKD-MBD), potassium disorders, severe acidosis,decreased fertility, and increased risk of complications ofpregnancy. CKD outcomes refer to progression to kidneyfailure and CKD-associated morbidity and mortality. Theseare wide ranging and include several CVDs, hospitalization, infections, and gout. Reducing the risk of CKD progression by targeting its underlying p
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	k of CKD progression by targeting its underlying pathophysiology may havebeneﬁcial effects on a range of CKD manifestations and CKD-associated outcomes, although some complicationsmay need speci ﬁc targeted interventions. Healthcare systems should aim to provide safe and proven cost-effectivetherapies that achieve CKD treatment and risk modi ﬁcation and to minimize limitations to access for people with CKDas their disease can substantially impact on QoL andhealthcare system resources. A key goal

A key goal for healthcareproviders should be to identify people at risk and to startsuch treatments early in the course of CKD to maximizepotential bene ﬁts.

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	anagementin Chronic Kidney Disease 23and considers that they should extend to all adults with CKD. We draw attention to thefollowing statements: Recommendation 3.2.2.1: We recommend that peo- ple with CKD be advised to undertake moderate- intensity physical activity for a cumulative durationof at least 150 minutes per week, or to a level compatible with their cardiovascular and physical tolerance (1D). Practice Point 3.2.2.1: Recommendations for physical ac- tivity should consider age, ethnic ba
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	physical ac- tivity should consider age, ethnic background, presence ofother comorbidities, and access to resources. Practice Point 3.2.2.2: People with CKD should be advised to avoid sedentary behavior. Practice Point 3.2.2.3: For people at higher risk of falls, healthcare providers should provide advice on the intensityof physical activity (low, moderate, or vigorous) and thetype of exercises (aerobic vs. resistance, or both). Practice Point 3.2.2.4: Physicians should consider advising/ encour
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	2.2.4: Physicians should consider advising/ encouraging people with obesity and CKD to lose weight. BMI relates to levels of adiposity on a population scale (though imperfectly), and a BMI of over 25 kg/m 2in adults (i.e., overweight or obese) is associated with an inc reased risk of multiple chronic diseases including development of CKD.439,440Such adiposity- CKD associations appear to be causal.441,442BMI can overestimate risk in people with high muscle mass,443and risk for a given BMI may var
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	gh muscle mass,443and risk for a given BMI may vary by ethnicity (with Asians being athigher risk of metabolic disorders at lower BMIs than Europeans). 443,444Nevertheless, it is important to provide people with CKD advice about their weight using BMI in conjunction with other information, including ethnicity, diet, comorbidity,physical activity levels, risk of falls, and laboratory values. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 3.2.2.5: Encourage children with CKD tound

The WHO recommends 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily for children 5 –17 years old, including aer- obic activities as well as activities that strengthen muscle andbone. 445Limits on sedentary time, particularly screen time, are also recommended. For children 1 –5y e a r so fa g e ,
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	recommended. For children 1 –5y e a r so fa g e ,1 8 0m i n u t e s per day of physical activity is recommended; young children int h i sa g eg r o u ps h o u l dn o tb er e s t r a i n e d( i . e . ,i nas t r o l l e ro rcarrier) for >60 minutes at a time. Only 13.4% of 224 participants of the CKiD study aged $12 years (median: 15 years) met these WHO targets, 240,257,303,305,446compared with 25% of general population children of comparable age.447Less than 2% of CKiD participants met screen t
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	.447Less than 2% of CKiD participants met screen timerecommendations ( <2 hours per day on school days) compared with 27% of the general population. Physical activityhas numerous bene ﬁts for cardiovascular, mental, and social health. Given that children with CKD are at higher risk forproblems in all these areas, physical activity may be even moreimportant in the CKD population. 3.3 Diet Practice Point 3.3.1: Advise people with CKD to adopt healthy and diverse diets with a higher consumption of
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	hy and diverse diets with a higher consumption of plant-based foods compared to animal-based foods and alower consumption of ultraprocessed foods. Practice Point 3.3.2: Use renal dietitians or accredited nutrition providers to educate people with CKD about di-etary adaptations regarding sodium, phosphorus, potas-sium, and protein intake, tailored to their individual needs, and severity of CKD and other comorbid conditions. Plant-based diets use proportionately more plant-based food choices, and
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	roportionately more plant-based food choices, and animal-based food is consumed in moderation. Diets such as Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension(DASH) are rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fatdairy foods. A Mediterranean diet pattern is built aroundvegetables, fruits, herbs, nuts, beans, whole grains, and seafoodbut also includes moderate amounts of dairy, meat, and eggs. By de ﬁnition, vegan and vegetarian diets are plant-based. A whole-food, plant-based diet low in animal-b
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ed. A whole-food, plant-based diet low in animal-based and ultra- processed foods may be helpful to slow the progression of CKDand delay need for dialysis via reduction of cardiometabolic riskfactors such as hypertension, CVD, diabetes, and obesity. 448,449 Ultraprocessed foods such as sugar-sweetened beverages, fastfoods, frozen meals, chips, candy, and pastries are high insalt, sugar, and fat, and low in nutritional value, and they promote in ﬂammation, which may contribute to worsening kidney
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ammation, which may contribute to worsening kidney function. A plant-based diet is rich in anti- inﬂammatory nutrients, ﬁber, and phytochemicals, and has been shown to reduce proteinuria and decrease metabolicacidosis. 448,449The probiotic nature of plant-based foods may also support the microbiome and reduce in ﬂammation and intestinal production of uremic toxins.450A recent systematic review evaluated the association of dietary patterns and kidney-related outcomes.451,452Dietary patterns that
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ney-related outcomes.451,452Dietary patterns that include more plant-based unprocessed protein have been demonstrated, in cohort studies and small RCTs, to slow thetrajectory of eGFR decline, reduce the risk of kidney failure,reduce risk of mortality, and improve scores in some QoLdomains (e.g., DASH and Mediterranean diet).www.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S207 3.3.1 Protein intake Recommendation 3.3.1.1: We suggest maintaining a protei
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	mendation 3.3.1.1: We suggest maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d in adults with CKD G3– G5(2C). Practice Point 3.3.1.1: Avoid high protein intake ( >1.3 g/kg body weight/d) in adults with CKD at risk of progression. Practice Point 3.3.1.2: In adults with CKD who are willing and able, and who are at risk of kidney failure, considerprescribing, under close supervision, a very low –protein diet (0.3 –0.4 g/kg body weight/d) supplemented with essential amino acids or ketoacid ana
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	emented with essential amino acids or ketoacid analogs (up to 0.6 g/kgbody weight/d). Practice Point 3.3.1.3: Do not prescribe low- or very low – protein diets in metabolically unstable people with CKD. This recommendation places a higher value on slowing the rate of GFR decline without the challenges associated with adherence to lower-protein diets, potential adverse effects, andthe contraindications in people with sarcopenia, cachexia, orundernutrition. The Work Group judged that many well-inf

Key information Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. The Work Group considered that maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight perday in adults in the absence of indications for a higher orlower protein intake was congruent with a person ’s culture and QoL. Considerations for protein restriction in the contextof individual preferences, true impact on CKD progressionba
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	dual preferences, true impact on CKD progressionbased on etiology, and other factors need to be consideredand weighed against any potential adverse impacts, such asmalnutrition. In many societies, most adults and older adults consume more protein than recommended, with average protein intakesof 1.2 g/kg/d. 453,454There is general agreement that, in the absence of intercurrent disease, the protein requirements forpeople with CKD are not different from those of healthysubjects. 455The Work Group t
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	from those of healthysubjects. 455The Work Group thus suggests maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d, a target consistentwith the WHO Recommended Dietary Allowances for thegeneral population. 456,457Figure 1923shows some examplesof the amount of protein in grams that would berecommended based on body weight. Clinicians shouldadvise people with CKD not to confuse grams of protein perday with the weight of food in grams (i.e., 100 g of meat contains only approximately 25 g of prot
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	g of meat contains only approximately 25 g of protein; Figure 20 23). Unlike carbohydrates and fats, excess dietary proteins cannot be stored in the body and are catabolized, leading to accumulation of protein waste products such as urea andother uremic toxins. As CKD progresses, these byproductsaccumulate and affect organ function. High-protein intakealso contributes to increased intraglomerular pressure andglomerular hyper ﬁltration, which, in turn, may lead to glo- merulosclerosis and tubuloi
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	turn, may lead to glo- merulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial injury. 458,459 Progressive decline in kidney function is also associatedwith a spontaneous loss of appetite potentially leading toinadequate protein and energy intake. 460The Work Group therefore encourages maintaining protein intake in adultswith CKD within the recommended range around 0.8 g/kgbody weight/d, and particularly avoiding excess proteinintakes ( >1.3 g/kg of body weight/d), which may be harmful for the kidney. 455There i
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	), which may be harmful for the kidney. 455There is observational evidence suggesting that excess protein intake may accelerate kidneyfunctional decline. 461–463 The protein type, not only the quantity, may also be relevant. Table 21 brieﬂy summarizes the impact of plant- based diets in people with CKD.464–470In another cohort study of older subjects (N ¼291, mean age 76 years) with eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, there was no signi ﬁcant association between vegetable protein intake and change ineGF
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	between vegetable protein intake and change ineGFR. 460Observational studies452,464,465and an RCT466 have associated a higher plant-based protein relative toanimal-based protein consumption or adherence to plant-based protein dominant diets with slower eGFR declineover time and lower risk of death; no study so far hasassessed the measures of patient preferences. 471It is unclear whether the associations are attributed to plant-based protein intake per se or to other nutrients or lifestyle habit
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ke per se or to other nutrients or lifestyle habits that accompany the plant-based protein intervention; however, there is biological plausibility. A crossover study of10 healthy individuals fed for 3 weeks evaluated the effectof a plant-based protein diet versus an animal-based proteindiet on kidney function parameters. Both diets provided thesame amount of total protein per day. Compared withanimal-based protein, a plant-based protein diet reduced renal plasma ﬂow, increased renal vascular res

Similar null associations were observed in a meta-analysis of 8 studiesinvolving people with diabetes and CKD. 478 However, there is some evidence that very low –protein diets (i.e., 0.3 –0.4 g/kg of body weight/d) under strict supervision can favorably impact kidney outcomes.

By lacking the amino group, ketoacid analogs serve as substrates for protein synthesis without the productionof toxic nitrogenous waste products.

There is concern that

However, in the meta-analysis byHahn et al., 47712 studies reported no evidence of malnutrition in their study participants, whereas 3 studies reported smallnumbers of participants in each arm with worseningnutritional status. The estimated average requirement forprotein intake in adults is approximately 0.5 –0.6 g/kg body weight/d, which corresponds to the amount of proteinrequi
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	d, which corresponds to the amount of proteinrequired to avoid negative nitrogen balance. 456Thus under correct supervision, these diets may not lead to malnutrition.Malnutrition may arise if the reduction in protein is followed by a reduction in energy intake. This may be preventable by adequate patient education on food choices and closesupervision by renal dietitians or accredited nutritionspecialists. A patient-centered approach involves a sharedunderstanding of treatment goals, effective co
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	aredunderstanding of treatment goals, effective communication toalleviate anxieties around food or food misconceptions,individualized advice that matches cultural values andpreferences, and assistance with implementation of dietetic advice in the face of a large symptom burden. Some of the trials on low-protein diets were conducted before treatment with RASi was introduced, and all of them before the SGLT2i era. Because the mechanism of action ofthese medications and that of low-protein and very
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	these medications and that of low-protein and very low – protein diets are complementary, it has been postulated thatthese strategies may synergize and maximize their combinedeffect on delaying CKD progression. 475,481,482Studies are needed to demonstrate this hypothesis. Low- or very low –protein diets are not indicated in people who are metabolically unstable or during periods of metabolicinstability. This includes conditions that may exacerbate therisk of malnutrition in the context of low-pr

The Work Group judged that some clinically suitable people would choose to implement a diet with protein of 0.8 g/kg body weight/d unless there areconditions that contraindicate such as sarcopenia, cachexia,or undernutrition. In addition, the Work Group judged that protein restriction would be implemented by many people as a way of managing their kidney disease.

The impact of protein restriction and the use of non –animal-based protein diets should be evaluated in the context of new care para-digms to ascertain the incremental gain of these strategiesrelative to the efforts and costs. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 3.3.1.4: Do not restrict protein intake inchildren with CKD due to the risk of growth impairment. The target protein and energy intake in children with CKD G2–G5 shou
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	and energy intake in children with CKD G2–G5 should be at the upper end of the normal range for healthy children to promote optimal growth. Children with CKD likely have similar resting energy expenditure to healthy children and should have total energyrequirements in the normal range. 483As in adults, protein restriction was considered for children with CKD in the past.Two RCTs have compared low-protein versus normal-protein diets in children with CKD. 484,485One found poorer growth for those
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ith CKD. 484,485One found poorer growth for those on a low-protein diet, and the other found no difference in eGFR between the groups. A 2007 Cochranemeta-analysis concluded that there was uncertainty over thepossible harm of strict low-protein diets on growth in younginfants. 486The 2009 KDOQI guidelines and the 2020 Pediatric Renal Nutrition Taskforce suggest maintaining an intake ofdietary protein at 100% –140% of the dietary reference intake (DRI) or the SDI for ideal body weight in children
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	(DRI) or the SDI for ideal body weight in children with CKDG3 and at 100% –120% of the DRI/SDI in children with CKD G4–G5. 487,488 Older adults. Practice Point 3.3.1.5: In older adults with underlyingconditions such as frailty and sarcopenia, consider higherprotein and calorie dietary targets. In older adults with CKD, nutritional management should consider potential challenges stemming from simultaneousand potentially con ﬂicting risks of CKD progression and malnutrition/protein-energy wasting.
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ogression and malnutrition/protein-energy wasting. In older adults, proteintargets should be set after careful individual assessment to identify the most urgent clinical challenge. Geriatric guidelines recommend protein intakes of 1.0 –1.2 g/ kg body weight/d to prevent age-related malnutrition and pre- vent sarcopenia. 489Such protein intakes may be appropriate in some people with stable or slowly progressing CKD, whoseclinical picture is dominated by old age and related challengesto their nutr

On the other hand,protein restriction may be appropriate in older adults whose primary clinical challenge is CKD with signi ﬁcant progression, provided they are metabolically stable. 490The course of action should consider patient preferences and when necessary, involve family members and caregivers.3.3.2 Sodium intake The Work Group concurs with the following recommenda-tion from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Gu
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	enda-tion from the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease 23and the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for theManagement of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease . 21 Recommendation 3.3.2.1: We suggest that sodium intake be <2 g of sodium per day (or <90 mmol of sodium per day, or <5 g of sodium chloride per day) in people with CKD ( 2C). Practice Point 3.3.2.1: Dietary sodium restriction is usually not appropriate for patients with sodium
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	s usually not appropriate for patients with sodium-wastingnephropathy. Global average sodium intake is estimated to be 4310 mg/ d (10.78 g of salt per day), which far exceeds the physiologicalrequirement and is more than double the WHO recommenda- tion of <2 g of sodium (equivalent to <5 g of salt) per day in adults. 491This perhaps re ﬂects the pervasive use of sodium in many commercial food products, which makes achieving WHO targets challenging to meet for many people. There arelarge-scale RC
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	g to meet for many people. There arelarge-scale RCTs quantifying the bene ﬁts of restricted salt intake (e.g., using 75% sodium and 25% potassium chloridesalt substitutes) to lower BP and reduce the risk ofcardiovascular events in the general population. 492In RCTs with up to 36 weeks of follow-up, reduction in dietary sodiumhas also been shown to lower BP and levels of albuminuria inpeople with CKD. 492–494Although presumed to reduce the risk of CKD progression and CVD, longer term trials have

People with CKD may have salt-wasting kidney disease,malnutrition, or be exposed to extremely hot climaticconditions. In such s
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	sed to extremely hot climaticconditions. In such scenarios, this recommendation may notapply. Special considerations Pediatric considerations. Practice Point 3.3.2.2: Follow age-based RecommendedDaily Intake when counseling about sodium intake forchildren with CKD who have systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure >90th percentile for age, sex, and height. The WHO recommends that the maximum intake of <2g / d sodium ( <5 g/d salt) in adults should be adjusted downward based on the energy requirem
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	be adjusted downward based on the energy requirements of children relative to those of adults ( Table 22 495). Children born with low birth weight (<2.5 kg) are at increased risk for CKD in later life and may also be at higher risk for hypertension and increased saltsensitivity. Salt sensitivity is a physiological trait by which BP in some people exhibits changes parallel to changes in salt intake. Children born with low birth weight may have a 37%increased salt sensitivity (de ﬁn e da sa ni n
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	37%increased salt sensitivity (de ﬁn e da sa ni n c r e a s ei nm e a nB Pwww.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S211 $3 mm Hg over 24 hours while on a high salt diet, when compared with a controlled salt diet). That sensitivity may increase further in those who are small for gestational age.496 Children with CKD often have underlying tubular condi- tions that predispose them to numerous electrolyte losses,including sodium. For these children
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	rolyte losses,including sodium. For these children, a supplemented ratherthan restricted sodium intake will be required. For non –salt- wasting children, salt intake should be limited to the age-based Recommended Daily Intake. 3.4 Blood pressure control The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure inChronic Kidney Disease , which encourages individualized BP targets and use of agents according to age, coexistent CVD, andother comorbi
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	according to age, coexistent CVD, andother comorbidities; risk of progression of CKD; and toleranceto treatments. 21We highlight the following guidance: Recommendation 3.4.1: We suggest that adults with high BP and CKD be treated with a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of <120 mm Hg, when tolerated, using standardized of ﬁce BP measurement (2B). Practice Point 3.4.1: Consider less intensive BP-lowering therapy in people with frailty, high risk of falls and frac- tures, very limited life expe
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	k of falls and frac- tures, very limited life expectancy, or symptomatic posturalhypotension. RCTs have not demonstrated that intensive BP-lowering results in meaningful reductions in the risk of kidney failure,but the RCT evidence supporting important cardiovascularbeneﬁts should encourage such a strategy. By aiming for an SBP <120 mm Hg, more adults with CKD will achieve an SBP <130 mm Hg, even if they do not meet the <120 mm Hg t a r g e t .O b s e r v a t i o n a l l y ,o na v e r a g e ,e a

The SPRINT trialexcluded people with diabetes, but

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	recommendedSBP target of <120 mm Hg to BP measurements obtained in a nonstandardized manner. 500A practical solution to ensure the identi ﬁcation of high BP is by using home-based monitoring (or telemonitoring). Trials have shown that 2 morning andevening BP measurements taken during the ﬁrst week of every month can be used to titrate antihypertensive medication andreduce BP more than “usual care ”approaches. 501 People who are frail, have limited life expectancy, or have a history of falls and
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	d life expectancy, or have a history of falls and fractures may have increased risk of addi- tional events if BP targets of <120 are achieved. Postural hypotension in these people is associated with adverse out- comes, and thus weighing the bene ﬁts of some attenuation of eGFR decline versus the life-changing impact of falls, fractures,and other events should be considered in choosing speci ﬁc targets.

The Work Group concurs with the KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Managementof Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease , and we high- light the following guidance 21: Recommendation 3.4.2: We suggest that in children with CKD, 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) should be lowered to £50th percentile for age, sex, and height (2C). Practice Point 3.4.2: Monitor BP once a year with ABPM and every 3– 6 months with standardized auscul

Practice Point 3.4.3: In children with CKD, when ABPM is not available, it is reasonable to target manual auscultatoryofﬁce SBP, obtained in a protocol-driven standardized setting, of 50th –75th percentile for age, sex, and height unless achieving this target is limited by signs or symptomsof hypotension. These statements with respect to children are generally worded to maintain consistency with the KDIGO 20

However, the suggestion to target auscultatory of ﬁce SBP at the 50th – 75th percentile when ABPM is not available departs fromTable 22 | Age-based sodium intake recommendations495 Age Recommended adequate sodium intake (g/d) 0–6 mo 0.110 7–12 mo 0.370 1–3 yr 0.370 4–8 yr 1.0 9–1

Practice Point 3.6.2: Changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2 –4 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi,depending on the current GFR and serum potassium. Practice Point 3.6.3: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the doseor stopping RASi. Practice Point 3

Practice Point 3.6.4: Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increasein dose. Practice Point 3.6.5: Consider reducing the dose or dis- continuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symp-tomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemiadespite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular ﬁltra- tion rate [eGFR] <15 ml

Practice Point 3.6.6: Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or ARB) for speci ﬁc indications (e.g., to treat hyper- tension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). The role of RASi (speci ﬁcally ACEi or ARB) in the manage- ment of BP and people with CKD, diabetes, and/or high BP havebeen speci ﬁcally considered in recent KDIGO guidelines. 21,23 Although temporari

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	est a $30% decrease in eGFR (rather than increase in creatinine) should be a trigger to investigate for an underlying othercondition. This represents a threshold above which the eGFR change is greater than would be expected from natural variation. Lastly, it should be noted that restricting salt intakemay help ensure maximal effects of RASi. Practice Point 3.6.7: Continue ACEi or ARB in people with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per1.73 m 2. In a recent STOP-ACEi trial of 411 parti

In a recent STOP-ACEi trial of 411 participants with mean eGFR of 13 ml/min per 1.73 m2, a policy of discontinuing RASi in CKD G4 –G5 did not result in any kidney or car- diovascular bene ﬁts.507Two observational studies have also found that associations suggesting outcomes were worseamong participants who stopped RASi after reaching anwww.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 S213 eGFR<30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, compared with those who co

We also highlight practice points fromthe KDIGO Diabetes guideline for diabetes management inCKD, which are also relevant for people with CKD withoutdiabetes: Recommendation 3.7.1: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2with an SGLT2i (1A). Practice Point 3.7.1: On
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	3 m 2with an SGLT2i (1A). Practice Point 3.7.1: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR fallsbelow 20 ml/min per 1.73 m2,unless it is not tolerated or KRT is initiated.Practice Point 3.7.2: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2iduring times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or criticalmedical illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis). Recommendation 3.7.2: We recommend treating adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A): /C15eGFR ‡
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	with an SGLT2i for the following (1A): /C15eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m2with urine ACR ‡200 mg/g ( ‡20 mg/mmol), or /C15heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria. Practice Point 3.7.3: SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring andthe reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generallynot an indication to discontinue therapy. Use of SGLT2i in people with T2D is recommended in previous guidelines irrespective of level of albuminuria. This n

This new recom-mendation (3.7.2) places high value on the importance of reducingrisk of kidney failure, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failurein people with CKD and high value on the large relative reductionsin risk for kidney disease progression in a series of large, placebo-controlled RCTs. It also places moderate value on the bene ﬁts of SGLT2i on risk of AKI, hospitalization for heart failure and myocardial infarction, risk of hospitalization

These beneﬁts appear to be irrespective of diabetes status, cause of kidney disease, or level of GFR. 511,512The bene ﬁts of SGLT2i in people with diabetes and CKD have been fully described inthe KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for DiabetesManagement in Chronic Ki

In a collaborative metanalysis including those 2 and 11 other trials (13 trials with just over 90,000 randomized par-ticipants) in comparison with placebo, those allocated to anSGLT2i experienced a 37% reduction in the risk of kidney disease progression and a 23% reduction in the risk of AKI irrespective of diabetes status ( Figure 22 ). 511

The certainty of theevidence for the kidney failure outcome in people withCKD without diabetes was downgraded to moderate due to imprecision (although clear bene ﬁts are demonstrated in the CKD trials: Figure 24 518). Neither RCT reported on the critical outcome of hospitalizations for any cause in the subgroup without diabetes

The Work Group judged that fully informed people with CKD with an indication for anSGLT2i would choose to receive SGLT2i for their provenbeneﬁts on risk of CKD progression, AKI, and a range of cardiovascular outcomes, their generally good safety pro ﬁle, and simplicity to implement (assuming local availabilityand insurance coverage if required).

Resource use and costs. Because of the high cost of KRT, SGLT2i have been found to be cost-saving in the people withCKD and diabetes recruited in the completed trials. 519 Generic SGLT2i are already available in some countries.From a healthcare system perspective, reducing the costburden of hospitalizations and dialysis is h

Considerations for implementation. The Work Group considered it safe to continue or even initiate an SGLT2iwhen the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2and continue their use until the time KRT is initiated (as wasthe approach used in the large CKD populationRCTs 403,513,514). We als

It is not routinely necessary to recheck blood tests after initiating an SGLT2i in adults with CKD (see Practice Point 3.7.3). 403 Reduced glomerular hyper ﬁltration resulting from SGLT2i can result in a dip in eGFR which is reversible.None of the large trials demonstrated an increased risk ofAKI in people treated with SGLT2i (Figure 22 ), an

Furthermore, a meta-analysis of the kidney disease progression outcome subdivided by primary kidney diagnosis demonstrated that there was no signi ﬁcant subgroup interaction by primary kidney diagnosis, and SGLT2i reducedthe risk of AKI by 23% in people with or without diabetes(Figure 22 ). 511SGLT2i also reduce the risk of hospitalization for any cause in people with CKD.403,520Some uncertainty remains about the effects on kidney dise

The slowrate of progression and small number of outcomes in the A1 subgroup limited the power for EMPA-KIDNEY to assess effects on the primary outcome in this subgroup. There were,however, important effects on the chronic (i.e., long-term)slope in all albuminuria subgroups, and signi ﬁcant reductions in progression using total slope analyses over the 2 years offollow-up in the A2 and A3 groups were considered separately(Figur

The overall certainty of evidence for the ef ﬁcacy of SGLT2i to delay CKD progression in people with CKD without diabetes is moderate (see Supplementary Table S1023,403,511,518,521–524).

Practice Point 3.9.1: The choice of GLP-1 RA shouldprioritize agents with documented cardiovascular beneﬁts.Results of the FLOW trial assessing effects of GLP-1 RA in a dedicated CKD population are awaited. It is a de ﬁnitive assessment of semaglutide on kidney outcomes in 3534 people with CKD, albuminuria, and T2D. 537aNevertheless, extrapolating current evidence from trials in people with

In 2012, a 2B recommendation was justiﬁed because alkali supplementation may be a promising low-cost, high-bene ﬁt adjunct treatment for people with CKD and may be accessible to all populations. This was based on an RCT that had suggested potential kidney disease progressionand nutritional bene ﬁts with no important increase in BP or heart failure complications. 1However, since 2012, a number of trials testing the hypothesis that sodium bicarbonatetherapy would slow kidney d

A 2021 systematic review identi ﬁed 15 trials with $3 months of follow-up in people with CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2and/or proteinuria) comparing the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate versus placebo or versus no studymedication on kidney outcomes.

In children, metabolic acidosis is also likely tocause growth retardation. Data from the observational CKiD study revealed that prepubertal children with acidosis who were treated with alkali had improved growth. 553In children with normal GFR but renal tubular acidosis, prolongedacidosis can also result in poor growth.

The KDOQIguideline on bone metabolism for children with CKDrecommends the prevention of acidosis in children tooptimize growth. 554There have not been any trials examining the effect of bicarbonate supplementation on CKD progression or growth in children. 3.11 Hyperkalemia in CKD Deﬁnition and prevalence.

Cooking methods such as soaking foods for 5 –10 minutes in previously boiled water can effectively reduce the potas-sium by half for some foods. 599Thus, educating peoplewith CKD and healthcare providers, using clear messaging,on dietary approaches to potassium management isneeded ( https://www.theisn.org/initiatives/toolkits/raasi-toolkit/ #1684867542809-330edb79-52b4 ),

For people with CKD and severe recurrent hyperkalemia (potassium >6 mmol/l), the balance to be considered is between the additional cost ofthe number needed to treat with potassium exchange agentsto prevent additional costs of hyperkalemia over and aboveCKD management costs.

If the price for potassium-loweringtherapy is lower than the reduction of inpatient and outpatient costs due to prevented hyperkalemia, the cost- beneﬁt ratio will be favorable because in addition to the health bene ﬁts, there is a net saving of healthcare costs resulting from potassium-lowering treatment.

Afteradjustment for age and sex, an eGFR consistent with CKD G3was associated with about twice the prevalence of gout (oddsratio: 1.96; 95% CI

Uric acid –lowering therapy was also found not to modify the risk of cardiovascular events or all-cause mortality in people with CKD. 150,609,610This reassuring cardiovascular safety pro ﬁle is consistent with general population data.

The overall certainty of the evidence for uric acid –lowering therapy among people with CKD and hyperuricemia is very low (see Supplementary Table S11150,612–614). The critical outcome of delaying progression of CKD was addressed by 7 RCTs.150,612,615–619The 2 largest RCTs were considered to ha

The certainty of the evidence was further downgraded because of very seriousimprecision. There were 81 kidney failure events among theparticipants in the 7 trials. The overall certainty of the evidence for delaying

However, the certainty of evidence for uric acid –lowering interventions in reducing frequency and severity of gout attack, and limiting tophaceousdeposition is consistently high, so the recommendation isgiven an overall grade of level C. Values and preferences. People with gout have rep

People with gout have reported that they were initially hesitant to start uric acid –lowering therapy, but that after experiencing improved control of inﬂammatory symptoms and tophi, they became strong advocates for its earlier institution.607 Resource use and costs. There are several generic xanthine oxidase inhibitors that are well tolerated and widely available at low cost. Considerations for implementation. In most countries, the cost and availability of uric acid –l

The risk of serious adverse events (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome) is related to the presence of speci ﬁc human leukocyte antigen (HLA) *B5801, which is more common in those of Han Chinese,Korean, Thai, and African descent. In speci ﬁc regions, assessment of the HLA type is recommended beforecommencing the drug; where testing is not available, closemonitoring at initiation of the medication
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	e, closemonitoring at initiation of the medication should be un-dertaken. At the current time, there is no indication to commence medication for high serum uric acid levels in the absence of symptoms. Rationale Uric acid –lowering therapy reduces uric acid levels and their associated symptomatic joint and skin complications, and aregenerally safe to use.Practice Point 3.14.1: Consider initiating uric acid –lowering therapy for people with CKD after their ﬁrst episode of gout (particularly where

Although the initiation of uric acid –lowering therapy in people with a ﬁrst gouty arthritis episode and no tophi was not recommended by the American College of Rheumatology,uric acid –lowering therapy use was suggested to be initiated in people with CKD G3 –G5, serum uric acid concentration >9 mg/dl ( >535 mmol/l), or urolithiasis at the time of the
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	( >535 mmol/l), or urolithiasis at the time of their ﬁrst episode of gout. This was justi ﬁed by the higher risk of gout progression and development of clinical tophi in CKD.607The ERT evidence review identi ﬁed that uric acid – lowering therapy results in an increased risk of a gout ﬂare during the ﬁrst 3 months after initiation in people with CKD. This is an expected short-term risk of uric acid lowering that people should be counseled about wheninitiating such therapy. Two relatively small ra

Two relatively small randomizedtrials have suggested that starting uric acid –lowering therapy during a gout ﬂare does not appear to extend ﬂare duration. 620,621Once initiated, the American College of Rheumatology suggests continuing uric acid –lowering therapy inde ﬁnitely.607 Practice Point 3.14.2: Prescribe xanthine oxidase inhibitorsin preference to uricosuric agents in people with CKD andsymptomatic hyperuricemia. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol an
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., allopurinol and febuxostat) reduce serum uric acid concentration by reducingpurine metabolism into uric acid. Uricosuric agents enhanceits urinary excretion (probenecid is an example), but theireffect is blunted in the context of reduced GFR. Note that theCardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat and Allopurinol in Par-ticipants With Gout and Cardiovascular Comorbidities(CARES) double-blind randomized trial of allopurinol versusfebuxostat in 6190 people with gout an

However, overallmortality and cardiovascular mortality were higher in thefebuxostat group than in the allopurinol group (HR for deathfrom any cause: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.01 –1.47 and HR for car- diovascular death: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.03 –1.73). 622In people with T2D, post hoc analyses from 2 large, placebo-controlled RCTs have report
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	from 2 large, placebo-controlled RCTs have reported that SGLT2i reduce serum uric acid concentration and appeared to reduce gout adverse event reports or initiations of uric acid –lowering therapy.515,623 Observational studies suggest that diuretics (thiazide andloop) increase serum uric acid concentration. 624The effect is mediated through multiple potential kidney-centeredmechanisms, which are summarized in a review of drug-induced hyperuricemia. 625www.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidn

The American College of Rheumatology recommended that colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids are preferred ﬁrst-line therapies for acute gout treatment based on demonstrated highlevels of evidence f
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ent based on demonstrated highlevels of evidence for ef ﬁcacy, low cost, and tolerability. 607 Administration early after symptom onset is encouraged. Forcolchicine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dosing (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg anhour later, with ongoing anti-in ﬂammatory therapy until the ﬂare resolves) was highlighted. 607Dose adjustment should be considered for CKD G5. Anti-in ﬂammatory treatment may be useful as prophylaxis against a symptomatic ﬂare when i

We have advised thatlow-dose colchicine is preferable to NSAIDs given the safetyand tolerability pro ﬁle and may also reduce risk of cardiovascular events. 626In contrast, NSAIDs can cause toxicity in CKD and need to be used cautiously.627Short courses of glucocorticoids titrated to symptoms response (e.g., 30 mgprednisolone orally for 3 –5d a y s )c

Practice Point 3.14.4: Nonpharmacological interventionswhich may help prevent gout include limiting alcohol,meats, and high-fructose corn syrup intake. High alcohol intake, high purine intake, and consumption of carbonated drinks are associated with higher levels ofserum uric acid. Consumption of these products in higheramounts is associated with both higher levels and goutsympto
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	associated with both higher levels and goutsymptoms. In contrast, diets that are low in fat and dairy, andhigh ﬁber, plant-based diets are associated with lower inci- dence of gout. Thus, diet modi ﬁcation may be of value in people with CKD, high uric acid, and gout. Serum uric acid levels among people with a history of gout are higher in those with higher versus moderate levels ofalcohol intake ($ 30 units/wk vs. <20 units/wk), as is the risk of recurrence. 624,628The odds of gout also appear

There are no uric acid –lowering trials in children. International considerations. Asian (as opposed to African and Caucasian) ethnicities may be at higher risk of seriousskin cutaneous reactions if they carry the HLA-B*5801 allele. It has been suggested that HLA-

It has been suggested that HLA-B*5801 allele screening may be considered in people who will be treated with allopurinol(although there is uncertainty that screening would be cost- effective). 634 Recommendation 3.14.2: We suggest not using agents to lower serum uric acid in people with CKDand asymptomatic hyperuricemia to delay CKD progression (2D). The Work Group judged that most well-informed people with CKD would prefer to optimize medical therapies that have proven bene ﬁt

On balance, despite obser- vational studies implicating elevated serum uric acid levels inthe progression of CKD, the data from systematic reviews andmultiple RCTs do not support treatment in the absence ofsymptoms. Given the pill burden and lack of data, there islit

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	riglycerides), butfollow-up lipid measurements are not required for themajority of people (i.e., a ﬁre-and-forget policy is recommended). 19This is because treatment initiation is based on risk, and the bene ﬁts of statin-based therapy have been shown to be independent of the level of cholesterol. Forthose with a total cholesterol >7.5 mmol/l (290 mg/dl) and a personal or family history of premature ischemic heartdisease (e.g., an event before the age of 60 years in anindividual or ﬁrst-degree r

There are clearrecommendations on when to initiate such therapies set out in the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for Lipid Management in Chronic Kidney Disease .19The Work Group concurs with all the recommendations in t

Practice Point 3.15.1.2: In people with CKD, choose statin- based regimens to maximize the absolute reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to achieve the largesttreatment bene ﬁts. Since 2013, published literature has continued to demon- strate the general safety of statin-based therapies. 667This includes individual participant-level data meta-analysis by theCholesterol Treatment Trialists ’collaboration

Based on a number of large RCTs in populations that are likely to be largely free fromCKD, lifelong use of low-dose aspirin (75 –100 mg) for the prevention of recurrence of complications of ischemic CVD isstrongly recommended among people with known CVD (a therapeutic approach referred to as secondary prevention).

Conversely, it is not possible to provide de ﬁnitive recom- mendations on when to use aspirin to prevent a ﬁrst ischemic cardiovascular event (i.e., primary prevention) in people athigh risk, and a research recommendation is provided. This isdue to uncertainty of the net absolute value of such anapproach, as any reduction in the risk of atheroscleroticcardiovascular events needs to be weighed against the risk of major bleeding. It is important to consider CKD-speci ﬁc data in

Key evidence from general populations is derived from a 2009 meta-analysis by the Anti-thrombotic Treatment Tria- lists’collaboration. The analyses included data on long-term aspirin use versus control care in 16 secondary preventiontrials (approximately 17,000 people at high average risk,approximately 43,000 person-years, 3306 serious vascular events [de ﬁned as myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardio- vascular de

The Work Group considered that some people with CKD without priorischemic coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral arterialdisease but at increased risk (e.g., due to diabetes) may stillwish to consider using aspirin and accept the risk of majorbleeding. 687Some people with CKD may also have a kidney diagn

Considerations for implementation. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are generally effective,692safe, and low cost (althoughoccasionally associated with an interstitial nephritis), andthe Work Group considers that it is prudent to considerbleeding risk and offers PPIs when prescribing antiplatelettherapy or antithrombotic therapy, particularly when such th

Any harm of bleeding is far outweighed by the bene ﬁts (unlike the situation for primary prevention, where bleeding risk has been consistently identi ﬁed in large aspirin trials and cardiovascular bene ﬁts to date have not). Practice Point 3.15.2.1: Consider other antiplatelet
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ctice Point 3.15.2.1: Consider other antiplatelet therapy (e.g., P2Y 12inhibitors) when there is aspirin intolerance. Bleeding from gastrointestinal mucosa with antiplatelet therapy is likely to be due to their effect on hemostasis of pre-existing mucosal lesions. This hypothesis is supported byP2Y 12inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel or ticagrelor) not reducing the risk of bleeding in trials comparing them to aspirin.694,695 However, if people are aspirin intolerant, a P2Y 12inhibitor is a noninferi

Note that in 2009, the FDArecommended that the coadministration of clopidogrel andomeprazole (a PPI) should be avoided because omeprazole reduces the effectiveness of clopidogrel. There is uncertainty about the precise effect of omeprazole as pharmacokineticdata are inconclusive, but PPIs with inhibition of CYP2C19are preferred when using clopidogrel. 696 Guidelines from the cardiology community provide rec- ommendations for the u

These guidelines recommend to apply the same diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in people with CKD. 663CKD does not modify the bene ﬁts of ticagrelor,697and antiplatelet therapy doses do not need to be modiﬁ ed at decreased eGFR.

It places value on the need for

It places value on the need for in-terventions, which carry risk to people with CKD and sub-stantial healthcare costs to demonstrate bene ﬁts on cardiovascular outcomes before they are considered a standard ofcare. Importantly, this recommendation should not apply tothose with severe angina symptoms, left ventricular dysfunction(e.g., ejection fraction <35%), or left main stem disease as they were excluded from the de ﬁnitive trials. It should be noted that trials in CKD have

Key information Balance of bene ﬁts and harm. Bene ﬁts.Beneﬁts should be considered in the context of the totality of evidence in people with and without CKD regarding interventions. Comparisons between aggressive medical therapy alone and invasive in-terventions do not support invasive strategies to reduce deathor prevent myocardial infarction. 707,707aHowever, tho

The review found no clear bene ﬁts on cardiovascular outcomes in 3 other trials and raised a hypothesis about beneﬁcial effects on mortality overall (Supplementary Table S13 700–704). Such an effect has not

The harms of invasive strategies include the risk of dialysis initiation, death, and stroke risk (stroke was inter-estingly not periprocedural). 707 Certainty of evidence. The ERT review was limited to trials only recruiting people with CKD (and did not include theISCHEMIA-CKD trial discussed above due to the inclusion ofsome people on dialysis and some people who have received akidne
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	dialysis and some people who have received akidney transplant). The overall certainty of the evidencecomparing coronary revascularization with optimal medicaltherapy among people with CKD not undergoing KRT andischemic heart disease is very low (Supplementary TableS13 700–704). Most of the RCTs reporting on the critical outcomes (all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, CVD events, kidney failure, and AKI) had some concerns regarding the risk of bias, particularly with lack of blinding for theoutcom
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	, particularly with lack of blinding for theoutcome assessors, participants crossing over to the othertreatment group, and the selection of reporting. Thecertainty of the evidence was downgraded for all outcomesbecause of imprecision. The certainty of the evidence forcardiovascular mortality was downgraded becausepublication bias was strongly suspected. Values and preferences.

However, invasive strategi

Access and availability of invasive therapies will vary in different healthcare sys-tems, as might the availability of medications for maximalmedical therapy. The key to implementation is to encourage the understanding of the value of full therapy as compared with invasive therapy so that healthcare providers andpeople with CKD
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	py so that healthcare providers andpeople with CKD understand the risks and bene ﬁts of invasive strategies. Given the costs of invasive strategies,there may be additional value to implementing thisrecommendation. Rationale Evidence suggests that the key indication for an initial invasivestrategy to manage stable ischemic heart disease is based onsymptoms, and intensive medical therapy is a suitable approach if symptom control is satisfactory in people with or without CKD. In CKD, the antiangina

Practice Point 3.15.3.1: Initial management with an inva- sive strategy may still be preferable for people with CKDwith acute or unstable coronary disease, unacceptable levelsof angina (e.g., patient dissatisfaction), left ventricular systolic dysfunction attributable to ischemia, or left main disease. The ISCHEMIA trial has been described as deeply dis- rupting prior attitu

It should also be noted that people with left ventricular dysfunction (i.e., ejection fraction <35%) or left main disease were excluded from the de ﬁnitive ISCHEMIA trial.707aThe Work Group considers that certain design features of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial m
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ertain design features of the ISCHEMIA-CKD trial may have led toangina bene ﬁts not being detected, and the trial results should not rule out angina bene ﬁts in people with CKD (see above). If an invasive strategy is pursued, there are effective strategies to reduce the risk of contrast-induced AKI (Chapter 4). 708 The totality of the evidence from the CKD-speci ﬁc trials is consistent with no net difference between an initial conser-vative approach using aggressive medical therapy versus aninva

This is consistent with the large gen-eral population-based ISCHEMIA trial. 707a 3.16 CKD and atrial ﬁbrillation In CKD, the same principles to diagnose and manage atrial ﬁbrillation should be used as in people without CKD. Prevalence and consequences. Atrial ﬁbrillation is the com- monest sustained arrhythmia, with risk increasing steeply with increasing age (earlie

Crudeprevalence ranging from 16% to 21% has been reported inpeople with CKD not requiring KRT. 710In the cohorts contributing to the CKD-PC, adults with CKD G3, A1 had an adjusted risk of atrial ﬁbrillation of 1.2 –1.5, increasing to an adjusted risk of 4.2 by CKD stages G5, A3 ( Figure 3912). Atrial ﬁbrillation can directly cause thromboembolism (particularly str

It is also linked, perhaps directly or through shared risk factors, with increasedrisk of death, hospitalization, vascular dementia, depression,and reduced QoL. 709Detailed clinical practice guidelines have been formulated by the cardiology community describing deﬁnitions, classi ﬁcation, diagnosis, screening strategies, and management.709It is beyond the scope of this KDIGO guideline to consider all aspects of the diag

Such an approach is low cost andsimple to implement. Figure 40 outlines approaches to different diagnostic and management strategies.

Oralanticoagulants should be considered for stroke preventionwith a CHA 2DS2-VASc score of 1 in men or 2 in women, considering net clinical bene ﬁt and values and preferences of people with CKD. Oral anticoagulants are clearly recom-mended for stroke prevention in people with atrial ﬁbrillation and a CHA 2DS2-VASc score $2 in men or $3 in women.709 Our Work Group considered tha

The presence of decreased GFR is a risk for thromboembolic stroke in people with atrialﬁbrillation. 710–712It has been estimated that approximately 95% of people with an eGFR of <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 have a CHA 2DS2-VASc score of $2, increasing to approximately 99% at an eGFR of

There isconsiderable scope to improve the predictive performanceof thromboprophylaxis risk scores for use in CKD. 713 Recommendation 3.16.1: We recommend use of non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in preference to vita

This recommendation puts high value on the use of NOACs, also referred to as direct-acting oral anticoagulants or DOACs, in people with CKD due to their simpler pharmacokinetic pro ﬁle, dosing, and monitoring than vitamin K antagonists and due to their improved ef ﬁcacy and relatively similar safety pro ﬁle.

Overall, NOACs signi ﬁcantly reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolic events by 19% compared withwarfarin (RR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.73 –0.91). This bene ﬁt was a result largely from reduced risk of hemorrhagic strokes (RR:0.49; 95% CI: 0.38 –0.64). There were large amounts of data on stroke in those with a CrCl of <50 ml/min, and the relative bene ﬁts were consistent and clearly evident in people with CKD. There were also consistent effects in su

There were also consistent effects in subgroupanalyses by age, sex, prior diabetes, prior stroke, and CHADS 2 score.714A more recent meta-analysis published in 2021 only focused on subgroups with CKD and included data from 7 trials of NOACs versus warfarin in atrial ﬁbrillation. It also reported a 19% reduced risk of stroke/thromboembolic complications in the NOAC group (HR: 0.81; 95% CI:0.69–0.97). 715Data in CKD G5 on dialysis were limited to observational studies.715Our evidence rev

There was a suggestion that major bleeding was signi ﬁcantly reduced in people attending centers where time in therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) rangewas<66% compared with centers with $66% time in range (interaction P¼0.02). This suggests that bene ﬁts of NOACs are in part a result of the

Medications can be highly bene ﬁ- cial, but some may be toxic, are excreted by the kidney, mayhave narrow therapeutic windows, or may have no provenclear evidence of bene ﬁt or indication in people with CKD. Drug stewardship refers to the effective, safe, and sus- tainable use of medications by all staff and physicians,encompassing the whole cycle of medication use. Medica- tions need to be prescribed responsibly, monitored for ef ﬁ- cacy and
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	escribed responsibly, monitored for ef ﬁ- cacy and safety, and when they do not or no longer serve their intended purpose, discontinued. This chapter discusseskey concepts in the processes of drug stewardship in peoplewith CKD. It is beyond the scope of this guideline to list allthe medications that may have altered risks/bene ﬁts in people with CKD. Such information is widely available indocuments that may exist at local, regional, or national bodies (e.g., British National Formulary: www.bnf.o
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	odies (e.g., British National Formulary: www.bnf.org )a n d in textbooks of pharmacology. However, we describe case examples to highlight the key classes of commonly pre-scribed medications in people with CKD. This guidance isbased on knowledge of pharmacology that has universalrelevance. In many cases, knowledge of altered risks/bene ﬁts of medications comes, however, from observational studiesand case reports from routine care. 4.1 Medication choices and monitoring for safety Abnormal kidney f
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	hoices and monitoring for safety Abnormal kidney function results in alteration in pharma- cokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and for people with CKD, as the GFR worsens, so does the prevalence of polypharmacyand comorbidities. 725People with CKD are at increased risk of medication errors and inappropriate prescribing (notedto be up to 37% in ambulatory outpatient studies and upto 43% in long-term care studies 726,727). Thus, improved understanding and collaboration with pharmacists indeveloping c
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	and collaboration with pharmacists indeveloping care plans and medication review is strongly recommended. People with CKD have reduced ability to excrete medica- tions and/or their metabolites (which may increase adverse event risk or exaggerate/diminish ef ﬁcacy) and increased sensitivity to medications (e.g., those bound to albumin inhypoalbuminemic states such as nephrotic syndrome).Additional issues include nephrotoxicity, diminished toler-ance of side effects in the context of coexisting c
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	nce of side effects in the context of coexisting comorbidities or older age, and lack of adequate evidence for either bene ﬁt or harm of speci ﬁc compounds, due to historical exclusion of people with (advanced) CKD from most clinical trials. 727,728As in all medical decision-making, healthcare providers should consider the indication, bene ﬁt-risk pro ﬁle, and po- tential nephrotoxicity while balancing accessibility, availabil- ity, local health policies, cultural practices, affordability, andpa
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	policies, cultural practices, affordability, andpatient preferences. Where available, consultation withpharmacists as part of the multidisciplinary team is encour-aged to assure optimized comprehensive medication man-agement and to improve pharmacoequity. Practice Point 4.1.1: People with CKD may be more sus- ceptible to the nephrotoxic effects of medications. Whenprescribing such medications to people with CKD, alwaysconsider the bene ﬁts versus potential harms. Between 18% –20% of people with
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	potential harms. Between 18% –20% of people with CKD G3 –G5 receive at least one potentially inappropriate nephrotoxic medicationannually, primarily NSAIDs, nephrotoxic antivirals, and bisphosphonates. 729Nephrotoxic medications may be indicated in people with CKD if expected bene ﬁts exceed potential harms.730However, whenever possible, healthcare providers should strive to use non-nephrotoxic alternatives. Common nephrotoxic medications to be aware of andpotential alternatives that could be p
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	aware of andpotential alternatives that could be prescribed instead arelisted in Table 31 . 725,731–738Although some nephrotoxic medications have viable alternatives, the alternatives may be less potent or there is limited comparison data on clinical outcomes, safety, and cost-effectiveness. Practice Point 4.1.2: Monitor eGFR, electrolytes, and ther- apeutic medication levels, when indicated, in people withCKD receiving medications with narrow therapeutic win-dows, potential adverse effects, or
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	erapeutic win-dows, potential adverse effects, or nephrotoxicity, both inoutpatient practice and in hospital settings. Ensuring a safe use of medication requires careful moni- toring for adverse effects and ef ﬁcacy. A key example includes the need to monitor potassium and creatinine during theinitial weeks of treatment with ACEi and ARBs (Figure 21 ). 23 Medications such as gentamicin and vancomycin have anarrow therapeutic range, with higher trough levelscommonly associated with AKI, and so re
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ough levelscommonly associated with AKI, and so require closemonitoring of GFR and medication levels during prolonged treatment. 731Other medications, such as lithium or methotrexate, require at least annual monitoring of creatinine to evaluate potential risks of nephrotoxicity. Practice Point 4.1.3: Review and limit the use of over-the- counter medicines and dietary or herbal remedies that maybe harmful for people with CKD.chapter 4 www.kidney-international.org S246 Kidney International (2024)
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	nternational.org S246 Kidney International (2024) 105 (Suppl 4S), S117–S314 Kidney disease can be induced or accelerated by the use of certain over-the-counter (OTC) medications, herbal rem- edies, and other dietary supplements. One of the most usedclass of OTC analgesic medications is NSAIDs.

Practice Point 4.1.4: When prescribing medications topeople with CKD who are of child-bearing potential, alwaysreview teratogenicity potential and provide regular repro-ductive and contraceptive counseling in accordance with the values and preferences of the person with CKD. When pregnancy is not desired, we note that while the eff

In addition, some recommended medi-cations to slow or prevent CKD progression are teratogenic (such as ACEi/ARBs or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors) and discont

A thorough medicationchart review is necessary to replace teratogenic medicationsbefore conception, or whenever this is not possible, ensure a strict monitoring plan with cessation of potentially

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	Consider GFR when dosing medicationscleared by the kidneys. Many medications and/or their active metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Failure to properly account for theeffect of GFR when designing appropriate drug-dosing regi-mens can predispose a person to treatment failure or adverseevents. 725,728Although guidelines for adjustment of the dosing regimen at varying severities of CKD provided bythe manufacturer are widely available in pharmacopeias,textbooks, online references, or local pr
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	acopeias,textbooks, online references, or local procedures, there maybe signi ﬁcant differences in information provided by these resources. 768 Practice Point 4.2.2: For most people and clinical settings,validated eGFR equations using SCr are appropriate fordrug dosing. Practice Point 4.2.3: Where more accuracy is required for drug-related decision-making (e.g., dosing due to narrow therapeutic or toxic range), drug toxicity, or clinical situ- ations where eGFRcr estimates may be unreliable, use
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ions where eGFRcr estimates may be unreliable, use ofequations that combine both creatinine and cystatin C, ormeasured GFR may be indicated. An assessment of GFR is important for guiding decisions related to the choice and dosing of medications. Section 1.2 addresses the accuracy of validated eGFR equations, as wellas indications for the use of eGFRcr-cys or mGFR. There is inconsistency between this guidance and those found in the package inserts or classic source references fordrug dosing. Regu

Regulatory agencies have not universallyrequired pharmacokinetics in abnormal kidney function formedication approval. 769In addition, although the Cockcroft- Gault formula for estimating CrCl has been used in many pastpharmacokinetic studies that serve as the basis for the drugdosing, there are multiple concerns with that equation. It was developed in an era when the need for standardization of creatinine measurements was not appreciated, womenand in
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	nine measurements was not appreciated, womenand individuals of Black race were not included, and thereare concerns about use of weight, which can be impactedby edema or obesity. 770However, to date, few studies have been conducted to compare different equations for eGFR inthe context of drug dosing/kinetics, etc.There is now a recognition by major regulatory agencies that “any contemporary, widely accepted, and clinically applicable estimating GFR equation is considered reasonableto assess GFR i
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	R equation is considered reasonableto assess GFR in pharmacokinetic studies. ” 770,771 Practice Point 4.2.4: In people with extremes of bodyweight, eGFR nonindexed for body surface area (BSA) maybe indicated, especially for medications with a narrowtherapeutic range or requiring a minimum concentrationto be effective. For assessment of CKD, it is relevant to compare the GFR according to a standard body size. For this reason, GFR estimating equations have been developed in units of ml/min per 1.7
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ons have been developed in units of ml/min per 1.73 m 2. However, because drug clearance is more strongly associated with nonindexed eGFR (ml/min) thanindexed eGFR (ml/min per 1.73 m 2), in very small or large individuals, this can result in over- or underdosing, respec-tively, as well as noninitiation of certain medications. 772,773 Nonindexed eGFR can be obtained by multiplying theindexed eGFR results by the person ’s BSA and dividing by 1.73 m 2, or by using an appropriate online calculator.
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	2, or by using an appropriate online calculator. Practice Point 4.2.5: Consider and adapt drug dosing inpeople where GFR, non-GFR determinants of the ﬁltration markers, or volume of distribution are not in a steady state. In people with rapidly changing health status, it can be a challenge to estimate the GFR. Serum concentrations ofﬁltration markers may be changing because of changes in true GFR and/or in non-GFR determinants of the marker (Section 1.2). In such settings for people who require

In such settings for people who require medications that are impacted by or could impact GFR, healthcare providersshould regularly assess risk, bene ﬁts, and value of the medication, and consider higher or lower doses thanindicated. Where possible, use medication level testing toguide dosing. 730,774 Special considerations Dose adjustments in cancer. GFR plays a large role in determining anticancer therapy, including anticancer agentselection, dosing, and eligibility for investigation

Creatinine decreases physi- ologically during pregnancy due to glomerular hyper-ﬁltration, and BSA varies. This creates challenges for usingGFR or eGFR equations. 54In such settings for people who require medications that are impacted by or could impactGFR, healthcare providers should regularly assess risk,beneﬁt, and value of medications. 4.3 Polypharmacy and drug stewardship People with C
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	.3 Polypharmacy and drug stewardship People with CKD are particularly susceptible to poly-pharmacy due to multiplicity of comorbidities and multiplephysician or health system encounters related to those. Mostpeople with CKD not treated with dialysis receive 6 –12 different medications per day. 763Polypharmacy leads to increased pill burden and potential harm due to medication errors and drug-drug interactions. Thus, healthcare providers, including clinical pharmacists, should be diligentin asses
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	g clinical pharmacists, should be diligentin assessing medication appropriateness, number, dose, andpotential interactions. Drug stewardship promotes safemedication use throughout the course of therapy.Medications need to be prescribed responsibly, monitored for ef ﬁcacy and safety, and when no longer required, discontinued. Practice Point 4.3.1: Perform thorough medication review periodically and at transitions of care to assess adherence,continued indication, and potential drug interactionsbec
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ued indication, and potential drug interactionsbecause people with CKD often have complex medicationregimens and are seen by multiple specialists. Medication review is essential for minimizing the occur- rence of medication-related problems (e.g., inappropriatelyhigh doses and drug interactions) that commonly occur in theCKD population. 777If a person no longer has an indication for a medication that may contribute to kidney injury (e.g.,PPIs), healthcare providers should recognize theopportunit
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ealthcare providers should recognize theopportunity to discontinue the medication. Medicationreview at each clinical encounter, especially care transitions, is an opportunity to review medication types, interval, and doses especially if the individual has experienced a declinein GFR (e.g., metformin) or physiologic changes that canimpact medication volume of distribution (e.g., volumeoverload and sarcopenia). 778Figure 46729discusses key steps in the medication review process.

More frequent medication reviewsmay be needed in older adults with complex medicationregimens compared with younger people with CKD. In the context of good drug stewardship, healthcare pro- viders should be aware of the issue of “prescribing cascade. ”A p
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	e aware of the issue of “prescribing cascade. ”A prescribing cascade is a sequence of events that begins whenan adverse event is misinterpreted as a new medical condition and a subsequent drug is prescribed to treat this adverse event. 779Before prescribing new medications to address newly reported symptoms, it is important to ﬁrst assess if the symptoms represent a side effect from an existingmedication. An example of a prescribing cascade is asfollows: peripheral edema because of calcium chann
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	follows: peripheral edema because of calcium channelblocker may be managed by initiation of a new medication(i.e., diuretic), which can lead to additional adverse reactions (e.g., hypokalemia and dizziness).

Sick day rules have been endorsed as useful gu

The mostreported problem is failure to restart the medication. 784The plan to restart medications should be detailed in the medicalrecords and clearly communicated to the patients. Pati

Patients mayadditionally bene ﬁtf r o mm e d i c a t i o nr e v i e ww i t h i nam o n t ht o ensure appropriate medications are restarted.Practice Point 4.3.3: Consider planned discontinuation ofmedications (such as metformin, ACEi, ARBs, and SGLT2i)in the 48 –72 hours prior to elective surgery or during the acute management of adverse effects as a precautionary measure to prevent complications. However, note that failure to restart these medication
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ver, note that failure to restart these medications after the event or pro-cedure may lead to unintentional harm (see Practice Point4.3.2). The rationale for temporary discontinuation of certain medications before elective surgery or procedures is to pre-vent perioperative AKI and other complications such as hy-potension or metabolic acidosis or hyperkalemia during the perioperative period. 735Medications that should be discontinued before elective surgery due to potential perioperative adverse

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	.787,788In the surgical context, antihyperglycemic agents such as sulfonylureas, metformin,and SGLT2i would be held because of fasting before thesurgery. Case reports, case series, and a systematic review of47 cases 739,740,789support the current recommendations that SGLT2i should be withheld at least 3 –4 days before the elective surgery.741,742 Temporary discontinuation of medications to manage adverse events is indicated in most cases. However, fear foradverse event recurrence often results i

In CKD, hyperkalemia or AKI are not uncommonadverse effects of RASi treatment, to which clinical guidelinesrecommend discontinuation of RASi and therapy reinitiationat low dosages when the event is resolved. 23,29,790,791Despite this advice, permanent discontinuation of RASi seems to be the most common clinical reaction to occurrence of adverse events.580,792Observational studies consistently show that withholding R

If medications are discontinuedduring an illness, a clear plan of when to restart the discontinuedm
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	a clear plan of when to restart the discontinuedmedications should be communicated to people with CKD and documented in the medical record. 4.3.1 Strategies to promote drug stewardship Practice Point 4.3.1.1: Educate and inform people with CKD regarding the expected bene ﬁts and possible risks of medications so that they can identify and report adverse events that can be managed. People with kidney disease have a role in drug stewardship, and given that they may receive medications from non- ne
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ven that they may receive medications from non- nephrology healthcare providers, people with CKD should beencouraged to inform those prescribers that they have kidneydisease to facilitate consideration of doses and potential sideeffect of medications. Thus, education and information forpeople with CKD inclusive for their population (i.e., literacy level and languages) are encouraged. Although brochures and conversations may be useful, interactive electronic healthapplications have been shown to
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	electronic healthapplications have been shown to be acceptable to patients andmay lead them to apply the knowledge gained more effec-tively. 793–797Practical implementation tips involve printing out the results of the most recent eGFR estimation for thepatient to bring along in future healthcare consultations and/or write down a list of ongoing medications to alert other healthcare providers of medication risks and bene ﬁts. A diagnosis of CKD should always be re ﬂected in medical records, as t

Clinical pharmacists are highly quali ﬁed experts in medi- cines and, as part of the multidisciplinary team, can play apivotal role in improving the quality of care and ensuring patient safety in a range of ways.

In RCTs enrolling people with CKD,electronic clinical decision support systems have demon-strated ef ﬁca

The reported risk of CA-AKI is higher with procedures involving arterial administration compared with venous administration of contrast. 814This difference in risk may be due to differences in patient populations (those who requirearterial cont

Known risk factors for CA-AKI are advanced age, heart failure, the volume of contrast material, proteinuria, hyper-glycemia, and use of RASi. 815The highest risk for AKI is associated with interventional (rather than diagnostic)coronary angiography (particularly in the setting of acutemyocardial inf

Thus, there are many potential bene ﬁts of nephrology referral in addition to those more commonlyrecognized such as identi ﬁcation of reversible causes of CKD, provision of treatment to slow progression of CKD, man-agement of the metabolic complications of CKD, and prep-aration for dialysis and transplantation.

Application of risk prediction tools (Chapter 2) may aiddecision-making in terms of identifying those at risk ofprogression a

Risk-based referral was compared with guideline referral criteria in a cross-sectional study from the UK. 829Analysis revealed that approximately 40% of patients classi ﬁed as at high risk of progression to kidney failure by KFRE ( >3% by 5 years) were missed by guideline referral criteria. Moreover, amodel predicting the timing of clinical outcomes, validated ina multicenter prospective cohort study of
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	dated ina multicenter prospective cohort study of 1517 people aged$65 years with eGFR 10 –30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, showed good performance for predicting the timing and occurrenceof KRT. Using this prediction model to guide referral forvascular access preparation resulted in less unnecessary arteriovenous ﬁstula surgeries than using eGFR thresholds. 830 In this section, we consider the evidence relating to timely referral for planning KRT in people with progressive CKD. The literature concerning
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	e with progressive CKD. The literature concerning late referral has been remarkablyconsistent with both clinical studies and narrative reviewsidentifying several adverse consequences of late referral andrelated bene ﬁts of early referral ( Table 34 ). Both individual and healthcare system factors are associ- ated with late referral for KRT planning. A systematic reviewof 18 studies and physician surveys identi ﬁed speci ﬁc factorsresponsible for late referral for KRT as shown in Table 35 . 831 W
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	late referral for KRT as shown in Table 35 . 831 We encourage each nephrology program to explore factorsassociated with late referral to improve referral patternsappropriately. People with kidney disease have never been randomized to early or late referral to nephrology services, and the de ﬁnition of late referral in the published studies varies between 1 and 12months before the start of KRT. Three months is probably lessthan the absolute minimum amount of time required forassessment, education
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	m amount of time required forassessment, education, preparation for KRT, and creation ofaccess, but 3 months is the most frequently employed de ﬁnition. A systematic review of 40 studies showed that early referral was associated with better clinical and biochemical outcomessuch as improvement in mortality at 3 and 5 years, decrease inhospitalizations, better access to vascular access and KRT withperitoneal dialysis, as well as improvements in BP , hemoglobin,and serum albumin ( Table 36 ). 832A

To date,there is no consensus on a single preferred patient-reportedoutcome measure (PROM) instrument to be used to assessthese symptoms. However, 3 generic tools have been recommended by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement (ICHOM) ( Table 37 ). The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Informa- tion System (PROMIS) tool has been evaluated in adults

Transition clinics may improve the outcomes of young people transitioning from pediatric to adult care. 900,901 Transition clinics may be staffed exclusively by pediatriccare providers and focus on preparation, or may be jointly staffed by pediatric and adult providers.
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	jointly staffed by pediatric and adult providers. 895,902Although joint pediatric-adult clinics are viewed as ideal, their superiority has not been demonstrated in randomized trials.Furthermore, feasibility may be limited by funding,geography, and staf ﬁng.

Even for young people without chronic illness, the interval between 14 and 25 years of age is a period of change andincreasing autonomy. Young people with CKD undergoingtransfer to adult care must navigate 2 transitions simulta- neously: the transition of care and the larger transition from childhood to adulthood. Development of the p

Development of the prefrontal cor-tex, responsible for planning, organization, and impulsecontrol, continues to approximately 25 years of age. Adultcare providers must recognize that young adults constitute ahigh-risk population requiring special care. 903Outcomes are poorer during this interval than at other times of life.904 Care must re ﬂect the fact that this is a high-risk period.

Practice Point 5.4.2: Initiate dialysis if the presence of one or more of the following situations is evident ( Tab
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	more of the following situations is evident ( Table 41 ). This often but not invariably occurs in the GFR rangebetween 5 and 10 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. Practice Point 5.4.3: Consider planning for preemptive kidney transplantation and/or dialysis access in adults when the GFR is <15–20 ml/min per 1.73 m2or risk of KRT is >40% over 2 years. These statements are worded very precisely to highlight the need to plan proactively for complex activities related toinitiation of KRT. Also, there is a need to
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ated toinitiation of KRT. Also, there is a need to address symptomsand to avoid the institution of dialysis therapy at an arbitrarynumber representing the degree of residual kidney function. Given the risks and bene ﬁts of KRT, as well as the potential imprecision of measurements, people with CKD need to be treated according to symptoms and signs, not simply basedon laboratory values. Data from the Initiating Dialysis Earlyand Late (IDEAL) RCT show no survival advantage to earlystart dialysis (i
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ow no survival advantage to earlystart dialysis (i.e., at higher levels of GFR). 905Thus, the statement as written should help the healthcare provider tobalance symptoms with laboratory values in decision-making. Secondary analyses of the IDEAL study showed no signi ﬁ- cant difference in QoL or healthcare– related cost between early and late start dialysis groups. 905,906Moreover, subgroup analysis of the IDEAL study revealed no bene ﬁts on cardiac outcome in the early-start dialysis group.907Si

Factors such as avai

Factors such as availability of resources, reasons for starting dialysis, timing of dialysis initiation, patient education andpreparedness, dialysis modality and access, as well as varied“country-speci ﬁc”factors signi ﬁcantly affect a person ’s expe- riences and outcomes. As the burden of kidney failurehas increased globally, there has also been a growing recogni-tion of the importance of patient involvement in determiningthe goals of care and decisions regarding t

The eGFR at which preemptive trans-plantation should be undertaken will depend on multiplefactors including the age and size of the child and the rateof progression of kidney failure but will usually be between eGFR 5– 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. In children, poor growth can also be a reason to initiate dialysis. The decision to start dialysis should be reached
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	. The decision to start dialysis should be reached in discussion with the child (if age appropriate), their caregivers,and their healthcare providers. Medical and psychosocialpreparations for the initiation of dialysis should begin wellbefore dialysis is required. Deferred initiation should not imply deferred preparation, and early discussions regarding medical and psychosocialpreparation for the initiation of dialysis should not be delayed(e.g., placement of dialysis access, dialysis modality s

In children, studies from the USRDS, the European Society of Paediatric Nephrology (ESPN), and the Australia and NewZealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry (ANZDATA) foundno bene ﬁt from starting dialysis early. 911–913Of 15,000 inci- dent children on dialysis in the USRDS, the mortality risk was36% higher for those with eGFR >10 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 compared with those with lo

Whereas comprehensive conservativemanagement is usually referred to as active medicalmanagement in people with kidney failure who choose notto have KRT. There are 3 distinct groups of people withkidney failure who receive comprehensive conservative carebecause pro
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	receive comprehensive conservative carebecause provision of supportive care differs for each. 915 Descriptions of each group are shown in Table 43 . There is increasing recognition that provision of organized care to those who are dying or choose to not pursue KRT is ofvalue to people with CKD and their families. Healthcareproviders involved in caring for these people should be aler-ted to this need. Comprehensive conservative care is an alternative treat- ment to KRT. This is planned, holistic,

Evaluating the prognosis of each person with CKD is very important because each person has a different disease pro-gression pattern.

KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	.Shared decision-making helps healthcare providers, peoplewith CKD, and family members to reach agreement on the treatment direction that is appropriate with the person ’s values and preferences and family goals. This process should be performed in a culturally appropriate way with consider-ation of appropriate health literacy.

However, despite thisinclusion of people with CKD in prospective RCTs, those withlower GFR remain under-represented. Before the KDIGO2012 CKD guideline, a low eGFR was an exclusion criterionfor almost every large cardiovascular and BP trial. As a result,we had a largely opinion-based literature. That is changing, and although still low, the proportion of the total CKD literature that is either an RCT, meta-analysis, o
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	literature that is either an RCT, meta-analysis, or systematicreview has doubled from 3.3% to 6.5% of published articlesin the 5-year period ending December 2022. Several large international interventional studies have been completed in the last 8 years, either speci ﬁcally tar- geting people with CKD and other comorbidities (mostnotably diabetes or CVD), or with CKD de ﬁned by eGFR and ACR criteria (e.g., Canagli ﬂozin and Renal Endpoints in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical Evalua

Interventional studies targeting speci ﬁc pathways and diseases are increasing as well, though limited in scale due to rarity ofconditions (e.g., IgAN, membranous nephropathy, andsystemic lupus erythematosus, etc.). There remain gaps in the evidence base to inform best diagnostic testing strategies, decision-making, and processesof care. In addition, some therapies
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	and processesof care. In addition, some therapies offering promise have notyet been adequately tested in people de ﬁned by speci ﬁc criteria with CKD (i.e., people without diabetes, children,women, PKD, frail, elderly, etc.) and people from low-incomeand low-middle-income countries. We, therefore, begin thissection detailing research recommendations with some gen- eral guiding principles for those designing studies to consider when addressing key questions that impact people living withor at ris
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	questions that impact people living withor at risk for CKD. Guiding principles for research 1. To ensure that the evidence base is directly applicable to all people with CKD, future studies should avoid auto-matic exclusion of older people, children, and youngadults<18 years old, and give consideration to pregnant and lactating people. The need for contraceptive re-quirements for trial participation should also be reviewed. 2. Decreased GFR should not be a reason for automatic exclusion from re
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ld not be a reason for automatic exclusion from research studies. 3. Estimating equations equally applicable to those with and without CKD are required for children and adolescents.4. For new equations predicting CVD and mortality risk as well as CKD progression, development andimplementation studies including validation in differentpopulations (geographic and demographic) arerequired. 5. Bene ﬁt-risk ratio assessments of old, new, and future medications should be performed by levels of GFR and
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	ications should be performed by levels of GFR and ACR and/or using validated risk equations. 6. Drug studies evaluating pharmacodynamics should consider using validated eGFR equations or mGFR for highly toxic drugs with a narrow therapeutic window,especially for those frequently used in CKD. As this maybe prohibitively expensive for some medications, epide-miologic studies may provide information for revisions tolabels for some drugs. 7. Pharmacokinetic studies in people with CKD should not auto
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	kinetic studies in people with CKD should not automatically exclude GFR categories G4 and G5. 8. Studies should consider measurement of ACR in all co- horts, whether speci ﬁcally focused on CKD or not, given additional prognostic value of this parameter for so manyoutcomes. 9. All studies should ensure attention to etiology of CKD, sex, gender, age, and SES considerations in design and analysis of results. 10. Use of novel study designs (platform, registry-embedded, and pragmatic trials), use of
KDIGO-2024-CKD-Guideline.pdf	, registry-embedded, and pragmatic trials), use of large administrative datasets, and implementation science methodologies (e.g., causalinference techniques) should be considered to enable theassessment and evaluation of interventions, processes, andmodels of care. 11. People living with CKD should be involved in clinical studies throughout the research process from identi ﬁca- tion of knowledge gaps to knowledge mobilization andstudy design.

BACKGROUND CKD occurring among people with dia-betes is common, morbid, and costly. The International Diabetes Federationestimates that 537 million people wereliving with diabetes in 2021, with anexpected i
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	ereliving with diabetes in 2021, with anexpected increase to 784 million by theyear 2045 (3). The prevalence of CKDamong people with diabetes is >25%, and it has been estimated that 40% ofpeople with diabetes develop CKD dur- ing their lifetime (4). As the prevalence of diabetes has increased, the preva-lence of CKD attributable to diabeteshas grown proportionally (4). Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure requiring kidney trans- plantation or dialysis worldwide (5). Inthe U.S., di
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	antation or dialysis worldwide (5). Inthe U.S., diabetes fueled a marked in- crease in the prevalence of kidney failure over the last 30 years and now accountsfor half of all new cases of kidney failure(6). Moreover, CKD markedly ampli ﬁes risks of ASCVD, heart failure (HF), cardio-vascular death, and all-cause mortalityamong people with diabetes (7,8). In the U.S., one of every ﬁve adults with diabetes is not aware of their diagno- sis (9). Awareness of CKD is even lower,with 9 of 10 individual
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	eness of CKD is even lower,with 9 of 10 individuals unaware of having underlying CKD, including 2 of 5 with severe CKD (6,10). In addition, both dia-betes and CKD disproportionately affectracial and ethnic minorities and olderadults. Insuf ﬁcient screening, diagnosis, and awareness impair efforts to imple- ment treatment and improve outcomesand exacerbate racial, socioeconomic, andethnic disparities. Furthermore, recentpopulation-based data uncovering dis- parities in access to glucose-lowering
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	ering dis- parities in access to glucose-lowering agents with proven kidney and cardio-vascular bene ﬁts further highlight the need for interventions that ensure moreequitable access to and use of thesepharmacotherapies across racial and eth- nic minorities (11). In the U.S., the total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2017 was $327 billion, including $237 billion in directmedical costs and $90 billion in reducedproductivity (12). The estimated globaldirect health expenditure on diabetes i
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	ated globaldirect health expenditure on diabetes in 2019 was $760 billion (13). CKD, with and without kidney failure, is a major driverof the cost of diabetes care. Costs of CKD,stroke, and heart disease are additive(14,15). SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS CKD is de ﬁned as persistent eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, albuminuria (ACR $30 mg/g), or other markers of kidney dam- age, such as hematuria or structure abnor-malities. Importantly, these measurements can vary within individuals over time, and persistenc
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	vary within individuals over time, and persistence for at least 3 months is there-fore required for diagnosis (16). For most people, CKD is not identi ﬁed as a result of symptoms; CKD is often di-agnosed through routine screening. Boththe ADA and KDIGO recommend annual screening of patients with diabetes for CKD (17,18) (Fig. 1). CKD screening shouldstart at diagnosis of T2D because evi-dence of CKD is often already apparentat this time. For T1D, screening is recom-mended commencing 5 years aft
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	, screening is recom-mended commencing 5 years after diag- nosis, prior to which CKD is uncommon. Screening is underutilized, particularly foralbuminuria. In typical practice in the2 Consensus Report Diabetes CareDownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/doi/10.2337/dci22-0027/689029/dci220027.pdf by guest on 03 October 2022  U.S., less than half of patients with T2D are screened for albuminuria in a given year (19). Clinical laboratories routinely report eGFR calculated from
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	aboratories routinely report eGFR calculated from serum creatinine and demographic data (20 –22). The American Society of Nephrology and National Kid-ney Foundation advocate using the 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Col- laboration (CKD-EPI) equation, which wasgenerated without inclusion of a term forrace and calculates eGFR without regard to race, to estimate glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) from creatinine, age, and sex (20). Another CKD-EPI equation that addi-tionally incorporates ser
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	D-EPI equation that addi-tionally incorporates serum cystatin C in- creases precision and reduces racial and ethnic bias, offering additional value inscreening and for con ﬁrmation of low eGFR in appropriate cases (23 –25). Calculation of the ACR in single-voided “spot”urine samples is most convenient to measure albuminuria. Early morningurine specimens are ideal, although sam-ples collected any time of day may beused. ACR has marked variability; there- fore, a con ﬁrmatory urine sample within 3
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	there- fore, a con ﬁrmatory urine sample within 3–6 months is recommended (26,27). KDIGO has codi ﬁed a CKD classi ﬁcation scheme based on eGFR and albuminuria that is endorsed by the ADA (26). In co-hort studies, risks of progressive CKD, cardiovascular events, and mortality all in- crease with categories of increasing albu-minuria or decreasing eGFR. Moreover,CKD stage and corresponding risk cate- gory can guide frequency of laboratorymonitoring, treatment, and referral to ne-phrology care (F
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	ng, treatment, and referral to ne-phrology care (Fig. 2). A cause of CKD other than diabetes should be considered in the presence ofother systemic diseases that cause CKD,when retinopathy is not present (partic-ularly in T1D), or with CKD signs notcommon to diabetes (e.g., glomerularhematuria, large and abrupt changes in eGFR or albuminuria, or abnormal serol- ogy tests). In the absence of such “red ﬂags,”CKD is usually attributed to dia- betes and treated accordingly. Ongoingresearch seeks to d
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	nd treated accordingly. Ongoingresearch seeks to de ﬁne CKD subtypes with more granularity and link novel sub-types to precision treatments (28,29). COMPREHENSIVE CARE Goals of Comprehensive Care Multimorbidity is common in patients withdiabetes and CKD, who are at high risk ofCKD progression, cardiovascular events, and premature mortality. Therefore, both the ADA (1) and KDIGO (2) emphasize theimportance of comprehensive, holistic,patient-centered medical care to improveoverall patient outcomes
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	ed medical care to improveoverall patient outcomes. The goals of comprehensive care are to treat the patient as a “whole ”person and incorporate coordinated multidisci-plinary treatment, structured educationto promote self-management, shared-decision making, and primary andsecondary prevention of diabetes-related complications, including CKD, ASCVD, andHF (2). This approach requires treatmentdirected to optimize lifestyle, pharmaco- logical therapy aimed at preserving organ function, and additio

With multiple interventions ubiquitously needed to optimize the care of peoplewith diabetes and CKD, it is crucial toavoid therapeutic inertia (30). Most pa-tients with diabetes and CKD have highresidual risks of CKD progression andcardiovascular disease despite treatment, and increasing options are available for risk mitigation. Patients may need
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	available for risk mitigation. Patients may need to beseen frequently to identify and imple-ment multiple therapies, some of whichmay interact. For example, RAS inhibitors,SGLT2i, and the ns-MRA ﬁnerenone all cause initial hemodynamic reductions inGFR. When indicated, such medicationsmay need to be added and adjusted se- quentially, with frequent assessments to institute and optimize care in a timelymanner.

In addition, the time required by the healthcare professional in managing the pa- tients care will be reduced. Patient pri-orities often do not align with healthcareprofessional priorities.

Ways in which patients can work with their health
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	Ways in which patients can work with their health care professionals to man-age their diabetes and CKD include ask-ing questions; becoming educated aboutdiet, physical activity, smoking cessation,glycemic control, and medications; talk-ing to peers and support groups in thediabetes and CKD community; becomingfamiliar with technology that is available to track progress; and understanding test results in preparation for health care ap-pointments (33).

Both guidelines also recommend alow-sodium diet (KDIGO <2,000 mg/day, ADA 1,500 to <2,300 mg/day), largely to control BP and reduce cardiovascular risk. The ADA and KDIGO guidelines also recommend targeting a dietary proteinintake of 0.8 g/kg/day, the same intakerecommended by the World Health Or- ganization for the general population.

KDIGO performed a systematic re- view of randomized trials and found noconclusive evidence that restriction of di-etary protein to levels <0.8 g/kg/day im- proves kidney or other health outcomesamong people with diabetes and CKD(2). While the ADA and KDIGO are alignedin this regard, the National Kidney Foun-dation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF KDOQI) has somewhat different recommendati

Consequently, bothguidelines emphasize the concurrent useof1)H b A 1cas a metric upon which therapeutic targets are de ﬁned based on randomized controlled trial (RCT) data,2) continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to assess effectiveness and safety of treat-ment among patients at risk for hypogly-cemia

Individualized Targets Both the ADA and KDIGO emphasize useof individualized glycemic targets thattake into consideration key patient char-acteristics that may modify risks andbene ﬁts of intensive glycemic control (Supplementary Table 1). Based on RCTdata, KDI

Based on RCTdata, KDIGO recommends an individual-ized HbA 1ctarget of <6.5% to <8.0% for patients with diabetes and CKD, with tar- gets in this range having been associatedwith improvements in survival, cardio-vascular outcomes, and microvascularend points, as well as lower risk of CKDprogression. The ADA recommends astarting HbA 1ctarget of <7% to reduce microvascular complications in most non-pregnant adult patients with T1D andT2D without hypoglycemia risk, althou

CGM and Diabetes Technology Diabetes technology refers to the hard- ware, devices, and software that patients with diabetes use to manage their chronicdisease and encompasses 1) insulin ad- ministered with syringe, pen, or pump;2) blood glucose monitoring with meter or CGM; and 3) hybrid devices that mo

The ADA and KDIGO guidelines highlight the im-portant role of CGM technology in im-proving diabetes management as a toolto identify and correct glycemic derange-ments, prevent hypoglycemia, direct medi-cation management, and guide medicalnutritional therapy and physical activity,as well as its rapid evolution in afford-ability and accuracy (2,37) (SupplementaryTable 1). Furthermore, ADA and KDIGOunderscore tha
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	Table 1). Furthermore, ADA and KDIGOunderscore that CGM may provide an advantage in glycemic control assessmentamong patients with T1D, as well as pa-tients with T2D using glucose-loweringtherapies associated with hypoglycemia.Other technologies supported by theADA include sensor-augmented pumpsthat suspend insulin when glucose is lowor predicted to become low, as well as automated insulin delivery systems that increase and decrease insulin deliverybased on sensor-derived glucose levelsand trend

BP Management BP management is universally acceptedas a critical goal for prevention of CKDprogression, ASCVD, and HF. The ADAincludes BP recommendations in eachannual Standards of Care and publisheda position statement on diabetes andhypertension in 2017 (38). BP control was highlighted as a key component of comprehensive care in the KDIGO 2020Clinical Practice Guideline for DiabetesManagement in Chronic Kidney Diseaseand KDIGO 2022 Clinical

The ADA and KDIGO BP recommen- dations share many similarities, includ- ing a focus on proper BP measurementtechniques, individualization of BP targets,and preferred drugs for treatment. Con-siderations for individualization of BP tar-gets
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	n-siderations for individualization of BP tar-gets include both anticipated bene ﬁts (e.g., higher absolute bene ﬁt for patients with higher underlying cardiovascular orkidney disease risk) and potential risks (e.g., ability to tolerate pharmacotherapy without experiencing adverse effects). For patients with diabetes, hyperten- sion, and high cardiovascular risk (i.e.,10-year ASCVD risk $15%), the ADA advises a BP target of <130/80 mmHg if this target can be safely attained. Forpatients with dia

Forpatients with diabetes, hypertension, andlow cardiovascular risk (deﬁ ned as those with 10-year ASCVD risk <15%), the ADA recommends a BP target of <140/90 mmHg (grade A recommendation) (40).The KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guidelinefor the Management of Blood Pressure inChronic Kidney Disease recommends atarget systolic BP of <120 mmHg withHarmonized clinical practice guidelinesMultidisciplinary education Self-management programsRisk mitigation strategiesImprove

With respect to preferred antihy- pertensive pharmacotherapies, there isconsensus that an RAS inhibitor, i.e., anACEi or ARB, should be initiated in pa-tients with concomitant diabetes, hyper-tension, and albuminuria, with titrationto the highest tolerated approved dose.This recommendation is based on RCTswhere

Speci ﬁcally, this in- cluded 1) adults $50 years old with CKD and eGFR $60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (grade 1B recommendation) and 2) adults aged 18 –49 years with CKD with diabetes, known coronary heartdisease, prior ischemic stroke, or esti- mated 10-year incidence of coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocar- dial infarction >10% (grade 2A recom- mendation). These recommendationsare based largely on results of t

Additional evi- dence from subsequent trials was incor- porated into recommendations in the 2022 ADA Standards of Care, which are endorsed by this consensusstatement. For primary prevention of ASCVD, the ADA recommends a moderate-intensitystatin for all adults with diabetes aged 40–75 years, those aged 20 –39 years with additional ASCVD risk factors (suchas CKD), and, with individua

An exception may be patients with kidney failure treated with dialysis for whom primary prevention of ASCVD events with a statin has been generally ineffective(47,49,50). High-intensity statin is recom- mended for secondary prevention for all patients with known ASCVD. For some patients, intensi ﬁcation of statin therapy (for primary prevention), addi

Glucose-Lowering Agents in T2D and CKD The ADA 2022 Standards Care and the KDIGO 2022 guideline recommend early initiation of metformin plus an SGLT2inhibitor in most patients with T2D and CKD (2,17) (Table 1). Additional glucose- lowering agents can then be added asneeded to meet individualiz

Prescriptionof glucose-lowering medications may belimited by eGFR (Table 3). Appropriatedose adjustment based on eGFR is im-portant for medications that increaserisk of side effects with low eGFR orundergo elimination through the kidney (Table 4). When needed, careful use and titration of insulin and sulfonyl-urea agents is recommended to avoidhypoglycemia. Metfo

Metformin Metformin is recommended for use inmost patients with T2D and CKD whohave eGFR $30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, although careful patient selection and downwarddose adjustment based on eGFR is recom-mended. Metformin has been proven tobe a safe, effective, and affordable founda-tion for glycemic control in T2D. Metfor-min is excreted unchanged in urine, withthe label including a boxed warning for in-creased risk of lactic acidosis in patients with CKD du

Evidence, however, suggeststhe overall risk for metformin-associatedlactic acidosis is low (53), and the U.S. Foodand Drug Administration has revised theU.S. label to re ﬂect its safety in most pa- tients with eGFR $30 mL/min/1.73 m 2(52). In facilitating safe use, eGFR should bemonitored at least annually in patientswith CKD, with the recommended fre-quency of monitoring increased to ev- ery 3 –6 months

It is recom- m e n d e dt h a tt h ed o s eo fm e t f o r m i nb e reduced to 1,000 mg daily in patientswith eGFR between 30 and 44 mL/min/1.73 m 2, and a reduction should also be considered in patients with eGFRof 45 –59 mL/min/1.73 m 2if they have a comorbidity that places them at increasedrisk of lactic acidosis due to hypoperfu-sion and hypoxemia (2). Most episodes of metformin-associated lact

Most episodes of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occur concurrent with other acute illness, oftenwhen acute kidney injury (AKI) contributesto reduced metformin clearance. There-fore, sick day protocols that specify hold-ing metformin doses during acute illnessmay help reduce the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis.diabetesjournals.org/care de Boer and Associates 7Downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/doi/10.2337/dci22-0027/689029/dci220027.pdf by gues

SGLT2i initiation is associated with a reversible decline in eGFR, but this gen-erally does not require drug discontin-uation. In fact, SGLT2i use appears toprotect patients from AKI (56). Notably,protocols for both CREDENCE and DAPA- CKD speci ﬁed continuation of study drug when eGFR fell below initiation thresholds. Therefore, it is reasonable to continue

Therefore, it is reasonable to continue ther-apy if the eGFR falls below the initiation thresholds unless the patient is not toler- ating treatment or KRT is initiated (2). Hypovolemia and hypoglycemia may occur with SGLT2i, but absolute risks arelow, especially at low eGFR. Therefore, adjustment of background therapies is generally not required when initiating anSGLT2i, but it may be prudent in somepatients, and follow-up to reassess volume status and glycemia is important (64).

Eu- glycemic ketoacidosis with minimal to noelevation in blood glucose may occur inpatients taking SGLT2i. Patients with T2Drequiring insulin are at particular risk. To mitigate risk, it is important to maintain at least low-dose insulin and consider pausingSGLT2i treatment during periods of acuteillness or stressors.

A meta-analysis of clinical trialsreported that genital mycotic infectionsoccurred in 6% of participants assigned to an SGLT2i, compared with 1% of those assigned to placebo (65).

Additional research is needed to deter- mine the role of SGLT2i in improving kid- ney outcomes in patients with T1D, among whom diabetic ketoacidosis is more common, and posttransplant, in which case immunosuppression may modify infection risks (66).

Once initiated, the SGLT2i can be continued at lower levels of eGFR. Use of Additional Glucose-Lowering Agents For patients with T2D and CKD requiring additional glucose-lowering agents, se- lection should be made in consideration of patient- and medication-speci ﬁcc o n - siderations (Table 2).

Similarly, the ADA gives strong support to use of GLP-1 recep- tor agonists in patients with T2D and CKD or ASCVD in consideration of their primary cardiovascular and secondary kidney bene ﬁts in large cardiovascular outcomes trials (17). Notably, GLP-1 receptor agonists retain glycemic ef ﬁcacy and safety even in advanced CKD stages. GLP-1 Rec

In cardiovascular out- comes trials, GLP-1 receptor agonistsreduced risk of major adverse cardio- vascular events (MACE) in patients withT2D (67 –70). Notably, the MACE risk

Notably, the MACE risk re- duction with liraglutide was signi ﬁcantly greater for those with eGFR <60 mL/ min/1.73 m 2than for those with eGFR $60 mL/min/1.73 m2(69). Although most participants in the cardiovascular out-comes trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists had established cardiovascular disease, the MACE reduction was similar betweenthose with and without previous cardio- vascular or kidney disease (71). Although there has not been a com- pleted kidney disease outc

The GLP-1 receptor agonists with favorable CKD outcomes include lixisenatide, exenatide (once weekly), liraglutide, semaglutide, albiglutide, dula-glutide, and efpeglenatide (67,68,70,72 –76). In a meta-analysis of eight cardiovascularoutcomes trials, GLP-1 receptor agonists signiﬁ cantly reduced risk for

In a gly-cemic ef ﬁcacy and safety trial in patients with moderate-to-severe CKD (CKD stages G3 and G4), dulaglutide was compared with insulin glargine as basal therapy(71,77).

There is anongoing clinical trial for a GLP-1 recep-tor agonist in T2D and CKD to evaluatewhether semaglutide will prevent $50% eGFR decline, kidney failure, or death due to kidney or cardiovascular causes (clinical trial reg. no. NCT03819153,ClinicalTrials.gov). Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are the most common side effects of GLP-1 re- ceptor agonists. These symptoms occur in 15–20% of patients with moderate- to-seve

Glycemic Management in Advanced CKD (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m2With or Without KRT) Glycemic management is particularly chal- lenging for patients with eGFR <30 mL/ min/1.73 m2, including those treated with dialysis, because of restrictions on drug use(Table 4) and lack of high-quality RCTs inthis population. For T1D, in

Doses are titrated toachieve individualized glycemic goals but may need to be decreased in compari- son with earlier stages of CKD due toreduced insulin clearance and other changesin metabolism with advanced CKD (78). In T2D, advanced CKD is a risk factor for hypoglycemia (29,79) and, when pos- sible, drugs that control glycemia with- out increasing risk of hypoglycemia arepreferred. Metformin is contrai

SGLT2i can be initiated with eGFR 20– 29 mL/min/1.73 m2and continued at lower eGFR if previously initiated and well tolerated. However,SGLT2i have minimal effects on glycemia in this range of eGFR and are of use mainly for kidney and cardiovascular ben-eﬁts not mediated through glycemia. GLP-1 receptor agonists have been stud- ied with eGFR as low as 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2and retain gl

GLP-1 receptor agonistsreduced ASCVD events and albuminuriain large RCTs and, thus, are theoreticallyappealing for people with T2D and CKD but have not been prospectively tested for cardiovascular ef ﬁcacy or safety in this population. However, ﬁndings of a meta-analysis of the cardiovascular out- comes trials showed that ASCVD risk was reduced at least as much among in

GLP-1 receptor agonists induceweight loss and can cause nausea and vomiting, so caution is warranted among patients with or at risk for malnutrition. Notably, in people with T2D and ad- vanced CKD who have obesity exceedingBMI limits required for kidney transplant listing, GLP-1 receptor agonists can be used to aid with weight loss that may facilitate qualiﬁcation
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	with weight loss that may facilitate qualiﬁcation for transplant. Selected dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhib- itors can be used with eGFR <30 mL/ min/1.73 m 2and in dialysis (Table 4) and provide a safe and effective option for treatment of patients who are not treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Thiazolidine- diones improve insulin sensitivity, a com-mon abnormality in advanced CKD, and retain antihyperglycemic effects in this population.

Insulin and short-actingsulfonylureas are often necessary to con- trol glucose when medications with less propensity to cause hypoglycemia are contraindicated, not tolerated, unavailable, or insuf ﬁcient. Glycemic Management for Patients With a Kidney Transplant Patients with a kidney transplant have been excluded from most clinical trials of glucose-lowering therapy. Therefore, data must be extrapolated from general popu

High-quality trial data are needed for this population. For T2D and posttransplant diabetes, it is reasonable to treat kidney transplant recipients with metformin according to eGFR, as for the broader population with T2D, because risks of metformin are re-
ADA-KDIGO-Consensus-Report-Diabetes-CKD-Diabetes-Care-2022.pdf	tion with T2D, because risks of metformin are re- lated to kidney function (80 –84). SGLT2i are promising drugs for kidney transplant recipients because they reduce intra- glomerular pressure, which may be el- evated in single functional kidneys, and may improve graft outcomes through this and other mechanisms. However,these beneﬁ ts have not been con ﬁrmed in clinical trials, and there is a theoreticalconcern that infection risks (i.e., genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections, Four

Therefore, more data are needed prior to makingrecommendations for or against treat- ment with SGLT2i for kidney transplantrecipients. Kidney transplantation and itstreatments do not substantially modify the known risks and bene ﬁts of other glu- cose-lowering medications, other than restrictions associated with eGFR.

The short interval between guidelines reﬂects the rapid pace of advances in the management of diabetes and CKD. The scope of the 2022 guideline is unchanged from 2020. The guideline addresses both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type2 diabetes (T2D), all stages of CKD (de ﬁned as persistent albuminuria [albumin –creatinine ratio {ACR} $30 mg/g {$3 mg/mmol}], persistently reduced estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate [e

The Evidence Review Team (ERT) ﬁrst updated the systematic literature search for each topic covered by the2020 guideline.

Chapters 2 (Glycemic monitoring andtargets in patients with diabetes and CKD), 3 (Lifestyle in-terventions in patients with diabetes and CKD), and 5 (Ap-proaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD)were deemed current, and no changes were made to recom-mendations or practice points.

Recommendations were graded using the “Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalua-tion”(GRADE) criteria. 2In addition, ungraded practice points were issued to provide guidance and context forimplementation of recommendations or when expertguidance was deemed necessary, but available evidence wasinsuf ﬁcient for a formal recommendation.

Like the 2020 guideline, the 2022 guideline advocates a comprehensive approach to assess the multiplerisk factors for these adverse outcome
Executive-Summary-KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	the multiplerisk factors for these adverse outcomes and partnership withpatients and healthcare systems to implement evidence-basedtherapies. Such multifactorial care has been shown to improveoutcomes in RCTs. 3–6 A pyramid graphic that summarizes components of comprehensive care of patients with diabetes and CKD has been updated to re ﬂect new recommendations ( Figure 1 ). The graphic has been rearranged to re ﬂect that drugs proven to improve kidney and cardiovascular outcomes arepart of a fou

For example, SGLT2i are ﬁrst-line ther- apy for people with T2D and CKD regardless of glycemia,but SGLT2i also lower blood glucose. Therefore, SGLT2i are considered a foundation of pharmacologic therapy for T2D and CKD, with additional agents layered on top of SGLT2iand metformin as needed to attain individualized glycemi

When designing patient-centered treatment regimens, we suggest that patients and healthcare professionals build fromthe base of the pyramid upward. Repeat evaluations at regularintervals are needed to ensure that interventions are titrated appropriately and combinations of interventions are pre- scribed to optimize care.

The ﬂow diagram shows that multiple aspects of care should be addressed in parallel,advanced over time through longitudinal evaluations, andrefreshed through repeat risk assessments. Regular screening for CKD with assessment of ACR and eGFR was stressed as being a critical prerequisite for correct diagnosis of CKD andimplementation of interventions. 7 SGLT-2 inhibitors Seve

An important modi ﬁcation is the lower eGFR threshold at which SGLT2i should be initiated. The 2022 guideline advocates initiating an SGLT2i for patients with T2D and CKD who have an eGFR$20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2(Figures 2 and3), as opposed to$30 ml/min per 1.73 m2in the 2020 guideline.

This approach should include a foundation of lifestyle modi ﬁcation and self-management for all patients, upon which are layered ﬁrst-line drug therapies according to clinical characteristics (in parentheses), additional drugs with proven kidney and heart protection as guided by assessments of residual risk, and additional interventions as needed tofurther control risk factors. Glycemic control is based on insulin for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and a combination of metformin and sodium-

Metformin may be given when estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) $30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, and SGLT2i should be initiated when eGFR is $20 ml/min per 1.73 m2and continued, as tolerated, until dialysis or transplantation is initiated. Renin –angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition is recommended for patients with albuminuria and hypertension (HTN). A statin is recommended for a

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are preferred glucose-lowering drugs for people with T2D if SGLT2i and metformin are insuf ﬁcient to meet glycemic targets or if they are unable to use SGLT2i or metformin. A nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (ns-MRA) can be added to ﬁrst-line therapy for patients with T2D and high residual risks of kidney disease progression and cardiovascu

Unfortunately, data remain insuf ﬁcient to make a recom- mendation on SGLT2i use for people with T1D and CKD,kidney transplant recipients, or patients treated with dialysis.These populations remain excluded from the SGLT2i recommendation, and the need for rigorous studies in these populations is highlighted in research recommendations.

Therefore, GLP-1 RA remain the recom-mended second-line drug class for glucose-lowering in T2D andCKD ( Figures 2 and3). The quality of supporting evidence for the use of GLP-1 RA continues to be rated as B because dedicated trials inpopulations with CKD have not yet been published (indi-rectness). The recommendation has a Level 1 strength ofrecommendation because the Work Gro

For this particular application, the demonstrated car-diovascular and possible kidney bene ﬁts of GLP-1 RA offer clear bene ﬁts to alternative drugs. The recommendation doesnot call for use of

The recommendation doesnot call for use of GLP-1 RA among patients with T2D who have achieved their target glycemic control with lifestyle,SGLT2i, and metformin, based on currently available data on GLP-1 RA risks and bene ﬁts. GLP-1 RA were also demonstrated to effectively reduce weight. 21–24Weight loss is an important goal of some obese patients with CKD, including those who want to lose weightto facilitate a kidney transplant.

These limitationsled to a strength of recommendation of Level 2 ( “we sug- gest”), as discussed in detail in the full guideline. This guideline issues a strong recommendation for use of an SGLT2i in the treatment of people with T2D and CKD,positioning SGLT2i as ﬁrst-line drug therapy to prevent CKD progression and cardiovascular events, regardless of glycemia (Figures 1 –3). This recommendation is based on 11 published clinic

SGLT2i were not standard of carewhen the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials were initiated. However, 877 participants were using an SGLT2i atbaseline, and the cardiovascular effects of ﬁnerenone, compared with placebo, appeared to be at least as bene ﬁcial among people using, versus not using, an SGLT2i. 27It is al

Therefore, patients with T2D and CKD who are treated with both an RASi and an SGLT2i andmeet criteria for ﬁnerenone (including residual albuminuria and non-elevated serum potassium) are appropria

SGLT2 inhibitors Recommendation 1.3.1: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m2with an SGLT2i (1A). Practice Point 1.3.1: The recommendation for SGLT2i is for kidney and cardiovascular protection and SGLT2i have been shown to have safety and bene ﬁt in CKD patients, even for those without T2D. Thus, if patients are already being treated with other glucose-lowering agents, an SGLT2i can be added tothe current treatment regim

Practice Point 1.3.2: The choice of an SGLT2i should prioritize agents with documented kidney or cardiovascular bene ﬁts and take eGFR into account. Practice Point 1.3.3: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness (when patients may be at greater risk for ketosis). Practice Point 1.3.4: If a patient is at risk for hypovolemia, consider decreasing thiazide or loop diuretic dosage

Practice Point 1.3.5: A reversible decrease in the eGFR with commencement of SGLT2i treatment may occur and is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy. Practice Point 1.3.6: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls be

Practice Point 1.3.7: SGLT2i have not been adequately studied in kidney transplant recipients, who may bene ﬁt from SGLT2i treatment, but are immunosuppressed and potentially at increased risk for infections; therefore, the recommendation to use SGLT2i does not apply to kidney transplantrecipients (see Recommendation 1.3.1).

Practice Point 4.2.1: The choice of GLP-1 RA should prioritize agents with documented cardiovascular bene ﬁts. Practice Point 4.2.2: To minimize gastrointestinal side effects, start with a low dose of GLP-1 RA, and titrate up slowly. Practice Point 4.2.3: GLP-1 RA

Practice Point 4.2.3: GLP-1 RA should not be used in combination with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.Practice Point 4.2.4: The risk of hypoglycemia is generally low with GLP-1 RA when used alone, but risk is increased when GLP-1 RA is used concomitantly with other medications such as sulfonylureas or insulin. The doses of sulfonylurea and/or insulin may need to be reduced. Practice Point 4.2.5. GLP-1 RA may be preferentially used in patients with obesity, T2D, and C

As always, it isnecessary to individualize care for speci ﬁc patients. The KDIGO 2022 guideline advocates a layered approach to care, starting with a foundation of lifestyle interventionsandﬁrst-line pharmacotherapy that has been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes.

KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	e the care and out- comes of patients with kidney disease worldwide throughpromoting coordination, collaboration, and integration ofinitiatives to develop and implement clinical practiceguidelines. ” The prevalence of diabetes around the world has reached epidemic proportions. The International Diabetes Federation estimated that 537 million people were living with diabetes in 2021. This number is expected to increase to 784 million by2045. It has been estimated that 40% or more of people withdia
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	been estimated that 40% or more of people withdiabetes will develop CKD, including a signi ﬁcant number who will develop kidney failure requiring dialysis ortransplantation. With a number of new agents targeting a variety of mechanistic approaches to improving outcomes for people with diabetes and kidney disease, KDIGO published its ﬁrst Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in CKDin 2020. However, in just under 2 years, the development ofadditional treatments and the continued pu

As with the 2020 guideline, this guideline update features a combination of both graded recommendations and practicepoints. Graded recommendations were based on a systematicreview of the evidence and are graded for both strength of there
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	evidence and are graded for both strength of therecommendation (level 1, “strong ”or level 2, “weak ”) and quality of the evidence (A, “high”;B ,“moderate ”;C ,“low”;o rD,“very low ”). Practice points are consensus-based state- ments representing the expert judgment of the Work Group, and are not graded. They are issued when a clinical question was not deemed a high priority for systematic review, to helpreaders implement the guidance from graded recommenda-tion, or for issuing “good practice st

Users should considerthe practice point as expert guidance and use it as they see ﬁt to inform the care of patients. Once again, we thank Ian de Boer, MD, MS and Peter Rossing, MD, DMSc for leading this important initiative. We are especially grateful to the continued dedication of theoriginal Work Group members who volunteered their timeand expertise to this update. In addition, we thank

KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	7 Introduction The KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) follows only2 years after the original KDIGO 2020 Clinical PracticeGuideline on this topic. The update was motivated by thewealth of high-quality new information that has quicklybecome available since the original 2020 guideline was pub- lished and by calls from the community to help guide application of these new data. The short interval betweenguidelines re ﬂects the rapid pace of
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	rval betweenguidelines re ﬂects the rapid pace of advancement in treatment of diabetes and CKD. A comprehensive process was undertaken to update the guideline. The Evidence Review Team (ERT) ﬁrst updated the systematic literature search for each topic covered by the 2020guideline. The Work Group reviewed the ERT summary of new studies by topic and judged by topic whether there was sufﬁcient new evidence to conduct a full quantitative reas- sessment with reconsideration of recommendations. Such f
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	nt with reconsideration of recommendations. Such fullreassessments were deemed to be warranted for use ofsodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i),glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), andmineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA). For thesetopics, the ERT updated the detailed extraction and meta- analysis of available data, and the Work Group revised the corresponding guideline chapters accordingly. Updates to sections on SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA include new data, additio
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	s on SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA include new data, additional discussion, modi ﬁcation of the SGLT2i recommendation to re ﬂect new evidence of bene ﬁts and safety with estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) $20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2(from$30 ml/min per 1.73 m2previ- ously) among people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and revised or added practice points and research recommendations. In addition, the SGLT2i section was moved from the “Glucose- lowering therapies ”chapter to the “Comprehensive care ” chapter
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	pies ”chapter to the “Comprehensive care ” chapter to re ﬂect growing acknowledgment that these drugs are an essential component of CKD care irrespective of gly-cemic effects. These changes were supported by multiple newlarge randomized controlled trials assessing the bene ﬁts and risks of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA. A new section on MRA was added to the chapter on “Comprehensive care in patients with diabetes and CKD ” (Chapter 1), with a new recommendation supporting use ofnonsteroidal MRA for patien
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ation supporting use ofnonsteroidal MRA for patients with T2D, residual albumin-uria despite ﬁrst-line treatments for diabetes and CKD, and normal serum potassium concentration. This section andrecommendation were indicated largely by 2 new trials eval-uating the bene ﬁts and risks of ﬁnerenone, a novel nonste- roidal MRA (ns-MRA). The 2022 guideline, as was the 2020 guideline, is designed to apply to a broad population of patients with diabetes andCKD. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and T2D are both add
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	andCKD. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and T2D are both addressed,with differences in approach to management highlightedwhen appropriate. Pharmacologic management of glycemia isone aspect of care that differs substantially by diabetes type.The guideline includes evidence-based recommendations for pharmacologic glucose-lowering treatment in T2D and CKDbut defers pharmacologic glucose-lowering treatment of T1D,based on insulin, to existing guidelines from diabetes orga- nizations. Similarly, the Work Group
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	iabetes orga- nizations. Similarly, the Work Group addressed care for pa- tients with all severities of CKD, patients with a kidneytransplant, and patients treated with hemodialysis or perito-neal dialysis. CKD is de ﬁned as persistently elevated urine albumin excretion ( $30 mg/g [ $3 mg/mmol]), persistently reduced eGFR ( <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2), or both, for greater than 3 months, in accordance with current KDIGOguidelines. This is an evidence-based guideline that focuses on clinical managem
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	e-based guideline that focuses on clinical management questions that can be addressed with high-quality scienti ﬁc evidence. Speci ﬁcally, we focused on ques- tions that have been addressed using randomized trials thatevaluated clinically relevant outcomes. This guideline is not atextbook. Our approach omits important aspects of clinicalcare that have become standard practice but are not addressedwith randomized trials —for which we refer readers to excellent existing texts and reviews —as well
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	to excellent existing texts and reviews —as well as new treat- ments that have yet to be suf ﬁciently evaluated for application to clinical care. Concurrent with developing the 2022 guideline, KDIGO partnered with the American Diabetes Association (ADA) toissue a consensus report on the diagnosis and management ofdiabetes and CKD. This report demonstrates the broad simi-larities across evidence-based recommendations from the 2 professional societies and emphasizes high-priority in- terventions
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ties and emphasizes high-priority in- terventions to improve the health of people with diabetes andCKD. In addition, the consensus report addresses aspects ofCKD prevention, screening, and diagnosis, which are importantclinical topics not explicitly covered in the KDIGO guideline. Diagnostically, CKD occurring among people with diabetes is usually attributed to diabetes, unless other causes are readilyevident. Certainly, cases of CKD occurring among people with diabetes are actually heterogeneou
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ong people with diabetes are actually heterogeneous, and some are caused by other processes. More work is needed to develop granularapproaches to CKD diagnosis and classi ﬁcation in diabetes and to determine the roles of kidney biopsy and biomarkers in thisevaluation. Here, we adopt the current clinical approach oftreating most presentations of diabetes and CKD similarly,modifying the approach as appropriate according to albu-minuria or eGFR category. We avoid the use of the term “diabetic kidne
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	gory. We avoid the use of the term “diabetic kidney disease ”to avoid the connotation that CKD is caused by traditional diabetes pathophysiology in all cases,although this term is entirely appropriate when this limitationis recognized. We also avoid the use of the term “diabetic ne- phropathy, ”an outdated term for which there is currently no consensus de ﬁnition. Prevention, screening, and diagnosis of new-onset diabetes after transplantation are also importanttopics that were considered to be
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	e also importanttopics that were considered to be out of scope for this guideline. The care of patients with diabetes and CKD is multifaceted and complex, as highlighted in our ﬁrst chapter, “Compre- hensive care in patients with diabetes and CKD. ”Several critical aspects of this comprehensive care, such as bloodwww.kidney-international.org introduction Kidney International (2022) 102 (Suppl 5S), S1–S127 S17 pressure and lipid management, were addressed in other KDIGO guidelines. These topics w
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ddressed in other KDIGO guidelines. These topics were not reviewed for thecurrent guideline, and we refer readers to prior KDIGOguidelines and the ADA-KDIGO consensus report. Fortu- nately, new treatments relevant to people with diabetes and CKD are currently being developed. However, such treat-ments were not included in this guideline if adequatelypowered randomized trials with clinical outcomes have notyet been reported. The Work Group aimed to generate an updated guideline that is both rigor
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	o generate an updated guideline that is both rigorously devoted to existing evidence andclinically useful. The group made recommendations only when they were supported by high-quality evidence from a systematic review generated by the ERT. However, practicepoints were made when evidence was insuf ﬁcient to make a recommendation but clinical guidance was thought to bewarranted. In some situations, recommendations could beissued for some groups of patients but not others. Forexample, evidence for
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	patients but not others. Forexample, evidence for patients treated with dialysis was oftenweak, leading to fewer recommendations for this population.Fortunately, almost all members of the Work Group, ERT, and KDIGO staff who contributed to the 2020 guideline alsoagreed to contribute to the 2022 guideline. As Co-Chairs, wewould like to recognize the outstanding efforts of all of these dedicated contributors, without whom this guideline would not have been possible. The Work Group was diverse,mult

The Work Group was diverse,multinational, multidisciplinary, experienced, thoughtful, andvigilant in its work. Notably, the Work Group included 2members who have diabetes and CKD who contributedactively as peers to keep the guideline relevant and patient-centered. Incorporating patients as partners has becomemore common in research, and we are pleased to see that this model is being adopted by additional clinical practice guideline development groups. We hope that the summaryg

We hope that the summaryguidance provided here will help improve the care of patientswith diabetes and CKD worldwide.

Practice Point 1.3.1: The recommendation for SGLT2i is for kidney and cardiovascular protection and SGLT2i have been shown to have safety and bene ﬁt in CKD patients, even for those without T2D. Thus, if patients are already being treated with other glucose-lower

Practice Point 1.3.2: The choice of an SGLT2i should prioritize agents with documented kidney or cardiovascular bene ﬁts and take eGFR into account. Practice Point 1.3.3: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness (when patients may be at greater risk for ketosis). Practice Point 1.3.4: If a patient is

Practice Point 1.3.4: If a patient is at risk for hypovolemia, consider decreasing thiazide or loop diuretic dosages before commencement of SGLT2i treatment, advise patients about symptoms of volume depletion and lowblood pressure, and follow up on volume status after drug initiation. Practice Point 1.3.5: A reversible decrease in the eGFR with commencement of SGLT2i treatment may occur and is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy.

Practice Point 1.3.6: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, unless it is not tolerated or kidney replacement therapy is initiated. Practice Point 1.3.7: SGLT2i have not been adequately studied in kidney transplant recipients, who may bene ﬁt from SGLT2i treatment, but are immunosuppressed and potentially at increased risk for infections; therefore, the recommendation to use SGLT2i does not apply to kidn

Practice Point 1.4.1: Nonsteroidal MRA are most appropriate for patients with T2D who are at high risk of CKD pro- gression and cardiovascular events, as demonstrated by persistent albuminuria despite otherstandard-of-care therapies. Practice Point 1.4.2: A nonsteroidal MRA can be added to a RASi and an SGLT2i for treatment of T2D and CKD.Practice Point 1.4.3: To mitigate risk

Glycemic monitoring Recommendation 2.1.1: We recommend using hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) to monitor glycemic control in patients with diabetes and CKD (1C). Practice Point 2.1.1: Monitoring long-term glycemic control by HbA1c twice per year is reasonable for patients with diabetes. HbA1c may be measured as often as 4 times per year if the glycemic target is not met or after a change inglucose-lowering therapy. Practice Point 2.1.2: Accuracy and precis

Practice Point 2.1.2: Accuracy and precision of HbA1c measurement declines with advanced CKD (G4 –G5), particularly among patients treated by dialysis, in whom HbA1c measurements have low reliability. Practice Point 2.1.3: A glucose management indicator (GMI) derived from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data can be used to index glycemia for individuals in whom HbA1c is not concordant with directly measuredblood glucose levels or clinical symptoms. Practice Point 2.1.4: Daily glycem

Practice Point 2.1.4: Daily glycemic monitoring with CGM or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) may help prevent hypoglycemia and improve glycemic control when glucose-lowering therapies associated with risk ofhypoglycemia are used. Practice Point 2.1.5: For patients with T2D and CKD who choose not to do daily glycemic monitoring by CGM or SMBG, glucose-lowering agents that pose a lower risk of hypoglycemia are preferred and should beadministered in doses that are appropriate
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	hould beadministered in doses that are appropriate for the level of eGFR. Practice Point 2.1.6: CGM devices are rapidly evolving with multiple functionalities (e.g., real-time and intermittently scanned CGM). Newer CGM devices may offer adv antages for certain patients, depending on their values, goals, and preferences. 2.2. Glycemic targets Recommendation 2.2.1: We recommend an individualized HbA1c target ranging from <6.5% to <8.0% in patients with diabetes and CKD not treated with dialysis (
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	with diabetes and CKD not treated with dialysis ( Figure 14 )(1C). Practice Point 2.2.1: Safe achievement of lower HbA1c targets (e.g., <6.5% or <7.0%) may be facilitated by CGM or SMBG and by selection of glucose-lowering agents that are not associated with hypoglycemia. Practice Point 2.2.2: CGM metrics, such as time in range and time in hypoglycemia, may be considered as alternatives to HbA1c for de ﬁning glycemic targets in some patients.CKD G1 Severity of CKDHbA1c < 6.5%< 8.0% CKD G5 Absent

Sincemulti-morbidity is common among people with diabetes andCKD, care usually involves many other specialties, includingbut not limited to ophthalmology, neurology, orthopedicsurgery, and cardiology. With the patient at the center, the team includes medical doctors, nurses, dietitians, pharma- cists, social workers, educato

In this guideline, the back-ground and organization of this chronic care model aredescribed in Section 5.2: Team-based integrated care. Structured education is critical to engage people with diabetes and CKD to self-manage their disease and participate in the necessary shared decision-making regarding the man- agement plan.
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	decision-making regarding the man- agement plan. Several models have been proposed, as outlinedin Chapter 5. It is essential that education be structured,monitored, individualized, and evaluated in order for it to beeffective. Individuals with diabetes and CKD are at risk for acute diabetes-related complications such as hypoglycemia anddiabetic ketoacidosis; long-term complications such as reti- nopathy, neuropathy, and foot complications; the risk of kidney failure with a need for dialysis or
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	isk of kidney failure with a need for dialysis or transplantation; andin particular, the risk of cardiovascular complications,including myocardial infarction, ischemia, arrhythmia, andheart failure. Comprehensive diabetes care, therefore, in-cludes regular screening for these complications and man-agement of the many cardiovascular risk factors in addition tohyperglycemia, such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, and lifestyle factors, including diet, smoking, and physical activity. Aspirin

Aspirin generally should be used lifelong for secondary prevention among those with established cardiovascular dis-ease (CVD), 1with dual antiplatelet therapy used in patients after acute coronary syndrome or percutaneous coronaryintervention as per clinical guidelines. 2Aspirin may be considered for primary prevention among high-risk in- dividuals,1but it should be balanced against an increased risk for bleeding, including thrombocytopathy with low glom
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	bleeding, including thrombocytopathy with low glomer-ularﬁltration rate (GFR). 3Although the risk for thrombotic and embolic events is high, the optimal antiplatelet andantithrombotic therapy in diabetes and CKD has not been well studied.4 For CVD prevention, statin therapy generally should also be used for secondary prevention among those with estab-lished CVD, for primary prevention for individuals over age40 with diabetes, and in primary prevention for persons overage 40 with CKD stages 1 –4

Speci ﬁc details on lipid management are covered in other KDIGO guidelines. Among persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular risk and mortality are dependent on the number of uncon-trolled risk factors. 6Multifactorial intervention is needed to target these risk factors with lifestyle modi ﬁcation, including
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	isk factors with lifestyle modi ﬁcation, including smoking cessation support, dietary counseling, physical ac-tivity, and pharmacologic intervention. Multifactorial inter-vention in T2D reduced the onset and progression of diabetic kidney disease, compared to currently recommended care. 7In addition, studies in people with T2D and early CKDdemonstrated the long-term bene ﬁt of multifactorial inter- vention on the development of microvascular and macro-vascular complications and mortality. 8,9We

Ongoing trials mayoffer additional new opportunities. 10 With multiple effective treatment options now often

Sequencing of interventionsshould be individualized to each patient ’s pressing individual clinical needs. For glycemic management in T2D, most guidelines recommend starting with metformin, while otherssuggest starting with SGLT2i or glucagon-like peptide-1 re-ceptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) in patients with CKD oratherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASC

In addition, many drugs have hemodynamic effects to reduceintraglomerular pressure, including renin-angiotensin systeminhibitors (RASi), SGLT2i, and MRA.

To accomplish this, frequent contacts may be needed and multidisciplinary team care canbe essential, as outlined in Section 5.2. This guideline focuses on selected topics for which evidence-based guidance can be provided; it does not covertopics like blood pressure and lipid management as these aredealt with in other KDIGO guidelines. However, managementof CKD in diabetes requires multifactorial risk factor control, including targeting

Overall, the guideline is designed to apply to a broad population of patients with diabetes and CKD. T1D and T2Dare both addressed, with differences in approach to man- agement highlighted as appropriate. Pharmacologic manage-ment of glycemia is one aspect of care that differs substantiallyby diabetes type; the bene ﬁts of nonsteroidal MRA have been demonstrated o

They were designed to determine whether RASblockade reduced the risk of progression and CKD in dia-betes, de ﬁned as the development of severely increased albuminuria ( >300 mg/g [ >30 mg/mmol]). The IRMA-2 study showed that treatment with irbesartan, an ARB, wasassociated

In the INNOVATIONtrial, the ARB telmisartan was associated with a lower tran-sition rate to overt nephropathy than placebo after 1 year offollow-up. 12In this trial, telmisartan also signi ﬁcan

However, after adjustment forthe difference in blood pressure levels between the placebo and treatment groups, the bene ﬁcial effect of telmisartan in delaying progression to overt nephropathy persisted. Furthermore, the bene ﬁcial effects of RAS blockade were shown to extend to patients with severely increased albu-minuria. Two landmark trials, the Irbesartan Diabetic Ne-phropathy (IDNT) 13and the Reduction of

In the IDNT trial, treatmentwith irbesartan compared with placebo resulted in a 33% decrease in the risk of doubling of serum creatinine concen-tration and was associated with a nonsigni ﬁcant reduction in the incidence of kidney failure, whi

In the RENAAL trial, losartan signi ﬁcantly reduced the incidence of doubling of serum creatinine, kidneyfailure, and death, each by 16% compared with placebo, incombination with “conventional ”antihypertensive treatment. The kidney protective effect conferred by losartan alsoexceeded the effect attributable to the small differences inblood pressure between the treatment groups. Consequently, an update to a C

Consequently, an update to a Cochrane systematic re- view 15performed by the Evidence Review Team (ERT) concurred with the original ﬁndings that the use of ACEi or ARB treatment in patients with diabetes and CKD was asso-ciated with a reduction in the progression of CKD with regardto the development of severely increased albuminuria (relativerisk [RR]: 0.45; 95% con ﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.29 –0.69 and RR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.35 –0.57, respectively) or doubling of serum creatinin

The sys- tematic reviews performed suggested that ACEi and ARBtreatment may cause little or no difference in the occurrenceof serious adverse events. However, angioedema has beenassociated with the use of ACEi, with a weighted incidence of0.30% (95% CI: 0.28 –0.32) re

It has been postulated that angioedema andcough are due to the inhibition of ACE-dependent degra-dation of bradykinin, and consideration can be given toswitching affected patients to an ARB, with which the inci-dence of angioedema is not signi ﬁcantly different from that of placebo (ARB: 0.11%; 95% CI: 0.09 –0.13 vs. placebo: 0.07%; 95% CI: 0.05 –0.09).
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	.09 –0.13 vs. placebo: 0.07%; 95% CI: 0.05 –0.09). Similar dose dependency of the albuminuria-lowering ef- fect, as described for IRMA-2, has been demonstrated inseveral studies with ACEi and ARB treatments, but the sideeffects increase with increasing doses. Thus, initiation shouldbegin at a low dose with up-titration to the highest approveddose the patient can tolerate. Post hoc analyses of randomized trials and observational cohorts have demonstrated that aninitial larger albuminuria reductio

The overall quality of the evidence was rated as moderate. From randomized controlled trials (RCTs)that compared an ACEi with placebo/standard, the quality ofthe evidence for critical outcomes, such as all-cause mortality,moderately increased to severely increased albuminuria pro-gression, and doubling of serum creatinine, was moderate(Supplementary Table S4 ). Additionall
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	was moderate(Supplementary Table S4 ). Additionally, in RCTs that compared ARB with placebo/standard of care, the quality of the evidence was moderate for these critical outcomes(Supplementary Table S5 ). In both comparisons, the quality of the evidence was initially downgraded to moderate becausechapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S32 Kidney International (2022) 102 (Suppl 5S), S1–S127 of serious study limitations, with unclear allocation conceal- ment across the studies. Other outcomes, suc

Other outcomes, such as cardiovas-cular mortality, cardiovascular events, and serious adverseevents, were sparingly reported in these studies. The impre- cision, in addition to study limitations, downgraded the quality of the evidence for these outcomes to low. The overallquality of the evidence has been driven by the critical out-comes of the doubling of serum creatinine and albuminuriaprogression, and not by the cardiovascular outcomes oradverse events, because o

The progression of CKD to kidney failure, the avoidance or delay in initiating dialysis therapy, and the antecedent risks associated with dialysis were judgedto be critically important to patients. In addition, the sideeffects with ACEi or ARB therapy, and the need for moni-toring of blood pressure, serum creatinine, and potassium,were judged to be important and acceptabl
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	otassium,were judged to be important and acceptable to the majority ofpatients. The Work Group, therefore, judged that most, if notall, patients would choose to receive RAS blockade treatment with either an ACEi or ARB for kidney protection effects, compared to receiving no treatment. This recommendationapplies to patients with either T1D and T2D, as well as kidneytransplant recipients; however, this recommendation does notapply to patients on dialysis. The evidence does not demonstrate superior
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	alysis. The evidence does not demonstrate superior ef ﬁcacy of ACEi over ARB treatment or vice versa, and the choice be-tween these 2 drug classes will depend on other factors, including patient preferences, cost, availability of generic formulations, and side-effects pro ﬁles of individual drugs. ACEi-induced cough is the predominant symptom of intol-erance to this class of drug, affecting about 10% of patients. 57 In clinical practice, affected patients are often switched to anARB so as not to
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	patients are often switched to anARB so as not to lose the kidney protective effects of RASblockade, although the improvement in tolerability has notbeen evaluated in an RCT. Resource use and costs. Generic formulations of both ACEi and ARBs are widely available at low cost in many parts of theworld. Moreover, both have been included in the WorldHealth Organization (WHO) list of essential medicines. 58 Considerations for implementation. ACEi and ARBs are potent medications and can cause hypoten
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ARBs are potent medications and can cause hypotension, hyperkalemia,and a rise in serum creatinine. The inhibition of aldosteroneaction and its effect on efferent arteriole dilatation could result in hyperkalemia and a rise in serum creatinine in pa- tients with renal artery stenosis. Consequently, blood pres-sure, serum potassium, and serum creatinine should bemonitored in patients who are started on RAS blockade orwhenever there is a change in the dose of the drug. Thechanges in blood pressur

Thechanges in blood pressure, potassium, and kidney functionare usually reversible if medication is stopped or doses arereduced. Figure 3 outlines the common types of ACEi and ARBs available and the respective recommended starting andmaximum doses based on their blood pressure –lowering ef- fects, including the need for dose adjustment with decline inkidney function.

The use of ACEi and ARB treatment has been associated with an increased risk of adverse effects to the fetus during pregnancy. Women who are planning for pregnancy or whoare pregnant while on RAS blockade treatment should havethe drug discontinued (see Practice Point 1.2.4). Rationale The presence of albuminuria is associated with an increasedrisk of progression of CKD and the development of kidney failure in patients with CKD and diabetes. I
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	idney failure in patients with CKD and diabetes. It has also been demonstrated that the degree of albuminuria correlates withthe risks for kidney failure and that both ACEi and ARBs areeffective in the reduction of albuminuria and even reversal ofmoderately increased albuminuria. It has been documentedthat the albuminuria-lowering effect is dose-related (but hasside effects as well). Thus, for maximal effect, start at a lowdose and then up-titrate to the highest tolerated and rec- ommended dose.
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	e to the highest tolerated and rec- ommended dose. Notwithstanding their anti-albuminuric effects, improvement in kidney outcomes has been demon-strated in multiple RCTs. In addition, both drugs are well-tolerated, and the bene ﬁts of treatment outweigh the incon- venience of needing to monitor kidney function and serumpotassium level after initiation or change in the dose of thedrug. This recommendation, therefore, places a high value onthe moderate-quality evidence demonstrating that RAS block

It places a relativelylower value on the side effects of these drugs and the need tomonitor kidney function and serum potassium level. This is a strong recommendation, as the Work Group judged that the retardation of CKD progression and preven-tion of kidney failure would be critically important to pa-tients, and the majority of, if not all, suitable p

Available data suggest that ACEi and ARB treatments are not bene ﬁcial for patients with neither albuminuria nor elevated blood pressure. In T1Dwith neither albuminuria nor elevated blood pressure, neitheran ACEi nor an ARB either slowed the progression of histo-logic features of diabetes and CKD or reduced the incidenceof albuminuria over 5 years. 39In T2D with neither albu- minuria nor elevated blood press

Cardiovascular risk reduction is the most important goal of blood pressure managementwith normal urine albumin excretion, and multiple classes ofantihypertensive agents (including RAS inhibitors, diuretics,and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) are appro-priate in this setting.

Practice Point 1.2.2: Monitor for changes in blood pressure, serum creatinine, and serum potassium within 2 –4 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of an ACEi or ARB(Figure 4 ).ACEi and ARBs are potent antihypertensive agents that counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin II.Moreover, blocking the action of angiotensin II causesselectively greater vasodilatation of the efferent arterioles of the glomeruli, resulting in a decline of the intraglomerular pressure, and not u

In addition, RAS blockade inhibitsthe action of aldosterone, leading to a greater propensity forhyperkalemia. An increase in serum creatinine, if it occurs,will typically happen during the ﬁrst 2 weeks of treatment initiation, and it should stabilize within 2 –4 weeks in the setting of normal sodium and ﬂuid intake. 61Therefore, pa- tients should be monitored for symptomatic hypote

KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	erefore, in patients with an acute excessive rise in serum creatinine ( >30%), the clinician should evaluate the potential contributing factors highlightedabove, sometimes including imaging for bilateral renal arterystenosis aiming to continue ACEi or ARB treatment afterthese risk factors have been managed. Practice Point 1.2.4: Advise contraception in women who are receiving ACEi or ARB therapy and discontinue theseagents in women who are considering pregnancy or whobecome pregnant. The use of

The use of drugs that block the RAS is associated with adverse fetal and neonatal effects, especially with exposureduring the second and third trimester. The association withexposure during the ﬁrst trimester, however, is less consistent. A systematic review of 72 published case reports and case series that included 186 cases of intrauterine exposure to RASblockade agents found that 48% of newborns exposed to anACEi, and 87% of those exposed to an ARB, deve

Across exposure to both ACEi andARBs, the prevalence of neonatal complications was greaterwith exposure during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The most common complications are related to impaired fetal or neonatal kidney function resulting in oligo-hydramnios during pregnancy and kidney failure after de-livery. 65,66Other problems include pulmon

The ﬁrst possible report of harm came from an epidemiologic evaluation of Medicaid data of 29,507 infantsborn between 1985
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	f Medicaid data of 29,507 infantsborn between 1985 and 2000,67which demonstrated that the risks of major congenital malformations, predominantlycardiovascular and neurologic abnormalities, were signi ﬁ- cantly increased among infants exposed to an ACEi in the ﬁrst trimester compared to those without exposure to antihyper- tensive drugs. However, there were other studies that did notdemonstrate such an association with ACEi use in the ﬁrst trimester, after adjusting for underlying disease charact
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	er, after adjusting for underlying disease characteris-tics, particularly ﬁrst-trimester hypertension. 68However, the limitation of most of the studies that showed a negative as-sociation with ﬁrst-trimester exposure is that they did not account for malformations among miscarriages, pregnancy terminations, or stillbirth. Therefore, the possibility of tera- togenesis with ﬁrst-trimester exposure to an ACEi or ARB cannot be con ﬁdently refuted, and caution must be under- taken in prescribing these
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	caution must be under- taken in prescribing these drugs to women of childbearingage. It is, therefore, the judgment of the Work Group that for women who are considering pregnancy, ACEi and ARBtreatment should be avoided. Likewise, women of child- bearing age should be counseled appropriately regarding the risks of ACEi and ARB exposure during pregnancy and theneed for effective contraception. Women who become preg-nant while on RAS blockade treatment should stop ACEi/ARBtreatment immediately an
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	tment should stop ACEi/ARBtreatment immediately and should be monitored for fetal andneonatal complications. Practice Point 1.2.5: Hyperkalemia associated with the use of an ACEi or ARB can often be managed by measures to reduce serum potassium levels rather than decreasing thedose or stopping the ACEi or ARB immediately ( Figure 4 ). The cardiovascular and kidney bene ﬁts of ACEi and ARB treatment in patients with CKD and diabetes, hypertension,and albuminuria warrant efforts to maintain patien
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	and albuminuria warrant efforts to maintain patients on thesedrugs, when possible. Hyperkalemia is a known complicationwith RAS blockade and occurs in up to 10% of outpatients 69 and up to 38% of hospitalized patients70receiving an ACEi. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia with the useof drugs that inhibit the RAS included CKD, diabetes,decompensated congestive heart failure, volume depletion,advanced age, and use of concomitant medications thatinterfere with kidney potassium excret
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	cations thatinterfere with kidney potassium excretion. 71Patients with these risk factors, however, are also the same population whowould be expected to derive the greatest cardiovascular and kidney bene ﬁts from these drugs. Although there are no RCTs testing the bene ﬁts and harms of mitigating hyperkalemia in order to continue RAS blockade therapy, stopping RASblockers or reducing the RAS blocker dose has been associ-ated with increased risk of cardiovascular events in observa-tional studies.
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	f cardiovascular events in observa-tional studies. 72,73 Therefore, identifying patients at risk of hyperkalemia and instituting preventive measures should allow these patients to beneﬁt from RAS blockade. Measures to control high potassium levels include the following74:chapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S36 Kidney International (2022) 102 (Suppl 5S), S1–S127 /C15Moderate potassium intake, with speci ﬁc counseling to avoid potassium-containing salt substitutes75or food products containing t

Both studies demonstrated the effectiveness ofachieving normokalemia and that treatment with RASblockade agents can be continued without treatment-relatedserious adverse effects. However, clinical outcomes were notevaluated; ef ﬁcacy and safety data beyond 1 year of treatment are not available; and cost and inaccessibility to the drugs insome countries remain barriers to their utilization. For the va

For the various interventions to control high potassium, pre-existing polypharmacy, costs, and patient preferencesshould be considered when choosing among the options. Practice Point 1.2.6: Reduce the dose or discontinue ACEi or ARB therapy in the setting of either symptomatic hy-potension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite the med-ical treatment outlined in Practice Point 1.2.5, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glome

The dose of an ACEi or ARB should be reduced or dis- continued only as a last resort in patients with hyperkalemiaafter the measures outlined above have failed to achieve anormal serum potassium level. Similar efforts should be madeto discontinue other concurrent blood pressure medicationbefore attempting to reduce the ACEi or ARB dose in patients who experience symptomatic hypotension. When t

When these drugs are used in patients with eGFR <30 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2, close monitoring of serum potassium level is required. Withholding these drugs solely on the basis of thelevel of kidney function will unnecessarily deprive many pa- tients of the cardiovascular bene ﬁts they otherwise would receive, particularly when measures could be undertaken tomitigate the risk of hyperkalemia. However, in patients with advanced CKD who are experiencing urem

Practice Point 1.2.7: Use only one agent at a time to block the RAS. The combination of an ACEi with an ARB, or the combination of an ACEi or ARB with a direct renin in-hibitor, is potential

Combination therapy with ACEi, ARBs, or direct renin inhibitors reduces blood pressure and albuminuria to a largerextent than does monotherapy with these agents. Long-termoutcome trials in patients with diabetes and CKD demon-strated no kidney or cardiovascular bene ﬁt of RAS blockade with combined therapy to block the RAS versus the single use of RAS inhibitors. However, combination therapy was asso-ciated with a higher rate of hyper

The EMPA-Kidney trial, although not yet published, also enrolled patients with an eGFR as low as 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2and was stopped early due to clear evidence of ef ﬁcacy.95 Currently, the safety and ef ﬁcacy of initiating SGLT2i for people with an eGFR <20 ml/min per 1.73 m2, in kidney transplant recipients, or among individuals with T1D, are notestablished and are currently being studied; further s

Recommendation 1.3.1: We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR ‡20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2with an SGLT2i (1A). This recommendation places a high value on the kidney and heart protective effects of using an SGLT2i in patients with T2Dand CKD, and a lower value on the costs and adverse effects ofthis class of drug. The recommendation

The recommendation is strong because in thejudgment of the Work Group, all or nearly all well-informedpatients would choose to receive treatment with an SGLT2i.

Thus, a 2019 meta-analysis pooled data from the EMPA-REG, CANVAS pro-gram, and DECLARE-TIMI 58 trials and examined cardio- vascular outcomes among individuals with and without CKD. 92For those trial participants with an eGFR of 30 to <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, an SGLT2i similarly reduced the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.47 –0.77) and MA

This result was also con ﬁrmed in a real-world registry, with the reduction in risk of hospitalization for heart failure and cardiovasculardeath associated with SGLT2i, mirroring the favorablewww.kidney-international.org chapter 1 Kidney International (2022) 102 (Suppl 5S),

The primary outcome was similarly reduced for individuals with or without diabetes, with no effect of het- erogeneity by diabetes status. The primary outcome was also similar among those with an eGFR $60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.63 –0.92) or <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.59 –0.86).

This ﬁnding suggests a po- tential role for cardiovascular bene ﬁt among CKD patients with HFrEF, even without the presence of diabetes. The EMPEROR-Reduced trial enrolled 3730 patients with HFrEF, de ﬁned as ejection fraction #40%, with an eGFR $20 ml/min per 1.73 m2(mean eGFR 62 ml/min per 1.73 m2), including 50% of individuals with T2D.101Over a median of 16 months, the primary outcome of cardiovascular death orheart failure hospitalization oc

As seen in DAPA-HF, the primary outcome was similarly reduced for individuals with andwithout diabetes. The primary outcome among those with an eGFR$60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2was HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.55 – 0.83 and for those with eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2was HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.69 –1.00.

In the CREDENCEtrial, 50% of patients had established CVD. Patients were randomized to canagli ﬂozin 100 mg daily or placebo and followed for 2.6 years, with the trial stopping early for su-periority as recommended by the Data Safety and MonitoringCommittee. The primary kidney outcome was de ﬁned as a composite of kidney failure, doubling of serum c

The primaryoutcome occurred in 43.2 and 61.2 per 1000 patient-years inthe canagli ﬂozin and placebo arms respectively, which translated to a 30% relative reduction in the primary kidney outcome by canagli ﬂozin (HR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.59 –0.82). Even for the secondary outcome of dialysis, kidney transplant,or death from kidney causes, there was evidence for signi ﬁ- cant bene ﬁt (HR: 0.72; 95%

There was no evidence of heterogeneity of treatment bene ﬁt of subgroups deﬁned by eGFR or ACR ( P-interactions were nonsigni ﬁcant). DAPA-CKD was the second SGLT2i trial with a primary kidney outcome. 94DAPA-CKD enrolled 4304 participants with or without T2D who had an eGFR 25 –75 ml/min per 1.73 m2and an ACR of 200 –5000 mg/g (20 –500 mg/mmol) and evaluated a primary outcome of a sustained decline in theestimated GFR of at lea

Over a median of 2.4 years,dapagli ﬂozin reduced the primary kidney outcome by 39% (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.51 –0.72). Findings were similar among patients with and without T2D. SCORED enrolled 10,584 participants with T2D and CKD (eGFR 25 to 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) and high CVD risk.96As described above, the study primary endpoint was modi ﬁedduring the trial, which was stopped ea

The secondary composite kidney endpoint of kidney failureor sustained 50% decline in eGFR had a HR of 0.71 (95% CI:0.46–1.08). In addition to the composite kidney outcomes, SGLT2i conferred less annual eGFR decline and a reduction in albu-minuria or decreased progression to severely increased albu-minuria. 88,93,105,110An updated 2019 meta-analysis pooled data from the 4 major RCTs of SGLT2i that evaluated majorkidney out

There was also reduction in kidney failure and AKI. The bene ﬁts of SGLT2i on kidney outcomes were seen across all eGFR sub-groups, 97including those with an eGFR of 30 –45 ml/m

In real-world registry data, after propensity matching, the initiation of SGLT2i was associated with a 51% reduced risk of composite kidney outcome of 50% eGFR decline or kidney failure (HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.35 –0.67). This ﬁnding suggests that the kidney bene ﬁts seen in clinical trials are generalizable to clinical practice.111 It should be noted that there is another RCT that should be informative.

This recommendation comes from high-quality dataconsisting of double-blinded, placebo-controlled RCTs ofSGLT2i that enrolled a subset of patients with CKD glomer-ularﬁltration rate category (G)1 –G3b (eGFR $30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2), a pooled meta-analys

There were 3 RCTs that enrolledexclusively patients with CKD, of which 2 had a primary kidney composite outcome and also reported on secondary cardiovascular outcomes. One additional trial (EMPA-KID-NEY) had a combined cardio-kidney outcome, was stoppedearly for ef ﬁcacy, and should report results soon. From these data, there is moderate- to high-quality evidence that SGLT2itreatment reduces

Resource use and costs. Economic models have found use of SGLT2i to be a cost-effective strategy among patients withT2D based on its cardiovascular bene ﬁts. 136,137These medi- cations nevertheless are frequently cost-prohibitive for manypatients compared to other cheaper oral diabetes medications(nota

However, more recent analyses have shown that cost-effectiveness in the cardiovascular outcomes trials was primarily driven by reducing costs of CKD progression and kidney failure. In ananalysis from the DECLARE-TIMI 58 trial, dapagli ﬂozin treatment increased lifetime quality-adjusted life-years(QALYs) and decreased costs of healthcare at a leve

In the US, obtaining reimbursement or preauthoriza-tion from insurance companies for SGLT2i coverage placesundue burden on healthcare professionals and patients. There are disparities in the insurance coverage for this class of medications and individuals ’ability to pay at current costs.

Ultimately, some patients may not be able to afford thesemedications and should be guided in making informed de- cisions about alternatives for T2D and CKD management.

Patients with T2D, CKD, and an eGFR $20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2have now been extensively studied in RCTs of SGLT2i. Participants with T2D and an eGFR as low as 30 ml/min per1.73 m 2were included in the EMPA-REG, CANVAS, and CREDENCE trials,87,90,93and ef ﬁcacy and safety in these studies were consistent across both eGFR and albuminuriadown to this threshold. The DAPA-CKD and SCORED trialsenrolled CKD patients with an eGFR down to as low

Direct evidence is provided by the DAPA-CKD, SCORED, EMPEROR-Reduced, and EMPEROR-Preserved trials, which enrolled such participants by design. In addition, post hoc analyses of CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD demonstrated that participants who met eGFReligibility at screening but subsequently had lower baselineeGFR prior to randomization ( <30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 and<25 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respect

However, within and across SGLT2i trials,beneﬁts and harms
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	within and across SGLT2i trials,beneﬁts and harms of SGLT2i have been apparent across subgroups de ﬁned by eGFR, albuminuria, and the presence or absence of heart failure, and the preponderance of data sug- gests that SGLT2i are safe and offer kidney and cardiovascular beneﬁts for patients with or without these speci ﬁc charac- teristics. Therefore, we recommend treating patients withT2D, CKD, and an eGFR $20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2with an SGLT2i. In subgroup analysis from the conducted trials, ef

Thus, this recommendation holds for patients of all ages and races, and both sexes. In addition, ef ﬁcacy and safety were demonstrated among subgroups with many commoncomorbidities and independent of concomitant use of med-ications commonly used in this population, including RASi.Therefore, SGLT2i can and should be added to the regimen ofpatients with T2D and CKD treated with a

However,long-term follow-up and further collection of real-world dataare needed to con ﬁrm the effectiveness and potential harms in speciﬁc patient populations. Speci ﬁcally, there is insuf ﬁcient evidence evaluating the efﬁcacy and safety of SGLT2i among kidney transplant pa- tients who may be more vulnerable to infections due to theirimmunosuppressed states; further studies should clarify thisissue. Therefore, this recommendation does not

A summary of SGLT2i agents with proven kidney or car- diovascular bene ﬁts, their Food and Drug Administration (FDA) –approved doses, and dose adjustments as recom- mended in CKD are described in Figure 7 .www.kidney-international.org chapter 1 Kidney International (2022) 102 (Suppl 5S), S1–S127 S45 Rationale For patients with CKD with an eGFR $20 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the current KD
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ith an eGFR $20 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the current KDIGO guideline recommends using an SGLT2i for the purposes of kidney and cardiovascular pro-tection, whereas metformin is still used for glucose controlamong patients with an eGFR $30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. The recommendation is strong due to the known kidney and/or cardiovascular protective effects in patients with T2D and CKD as shown in high-quality trials, such as EMPA-REG,CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58, CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD,SCORED, DAPA-HF, SOLOIST, EMP
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	, CREDENCE, DAPA-CKD,SCORED, DAPA-HF, SOLOIST, EMPEROR-Reduced andEMPEROR-Preserved. VERTIS CV showed cardiovascularnon-inferiority, as well as safety. In the judgment of the WorkGroup, nearly all well-informed patients would prefer toreceive this treatment over the risks of developing diabetic ketoacidosis, mycotic infections, and foot complications. As mentioned above, the EMPA-KIDNEY trial will report results by the end of 2022. Once the full trial data are pub-lished, KDIGO will incorporate
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	trial data are pub-lished, KDIGO will incorporate the new data into meta-analyses to provide updated summary estimates of SGLT2ibeneﬁts and risks. The prioritization of SGLT2i therapy in high-risk patients such as those with CKD is consistent with the recommen- dations from other professional societies including the American College of Cardiology (ACC), 142the joint state- ment by the ADA and the European Association of the Studyof Diabetes (EASD), 143and the joint guideline by the Euro- pean So
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	), 143and the joint guideline by the Euro- pean Society of Cardiology (ESC) and EASD.144The ADA/ EASD statement recommends that patients with T2D whohave established ASCVD, CKD, or clinical heart failure betreated with an SGLT2i (or GLP-1 RA) with proven cardio- vascular bene ﬁt as part of a glucose-lowering regimen inde- pendent of HbA1c, but with consideration of patient-speci ﬁc factors. 145–147 There is a lack of clarity across guidelines regarding initial therapy for patients not yet treate
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	arding initial therapy for patients not yet treated with a glucose-loweringdrug. Most guidelines suggest initial therapy with metfor-min, whereas the ESC guideline recommends initial therapywith an SGLT2i for patients with high CVD risk. The current KDIGO guideline recommends using an SGLT2i for most patients with T2D, CKD, and an eGFR $20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2and using metformin for patients with T2D, CKD, and an eGFR$30 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Sequencing of interventions should be individualized to
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	cing of interventions should be individualized to address most pressing individualclinical needs (Section 1.1). The 2019 ESC guideline provided a Class I recommenda- tion to use SGLT2i for patients with T2D and ASCVD or at high/very high cardiovascular risk (which includes target or- gan damage such as CKD). 144The difference between the ESC/EASD recommendation and the current KDIGOrecommendation may stem from different judgments aboutthe importance of the population studied in the landmarkclini
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	nce of the population studied in the landmarkclinical trials. Thus, the evidence is particularly strong for thepopulation corresponding to the CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD studies (ACR >200–300 mg/g [ >20–30 mg/mmol] and eGFR >25–30 and <75–90 ml/min per 1.73 m 2.I ncontrast, the current evidence bene ﬁt seen for patients with less albumin excretion comes from cardiovascular outcometrials with secondary kidney outcomes; however, EMPA-KIDNEY also enrolled patients with CKD without albumin- uria, and the
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	d patients with CKD without albumin- uria, and these results will be informative when published. The ef ﬁcacy and safety of SGLT2i has not been established in T1D. Use of SGLT2i treatment in the US remains off-label, as the FDA has not approved its use in T1D. InEurope, the European Commission has approved dapagli-ﬂozin and sotagli ﬂozin for use in T1D as an adjunct to in- sulin in 2019. However, the drugmaker of dapagli ﬂozin withdrew its T1D indication in 2021, citing concerns about diabetic k
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	dication in 2021, citing concerns about diabetic ketoacidosis. Dapagli ﬂozin remains approved in Japan for T1D. Practice Point 1.3.1: The recommendation for SGLT2i is for kidney and cardiovascular protection and SGLT2i have beenshown to have safety and bene ﬁt in CKD patients, even for those without T2D. Thus, if patients are already beingtreated with other glucose-lowering agents, an SGLT2i can be added to the current treatment regimen ( Figure 6 148). For patients already being treated with gl
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	6 148). For patients already being treated with glucose-lowering medications, SGLT2i can be added to the existing medicalregimen. The risk of hypoglycemia is low with SGLT2imonotherapy, as the drug-induced glycosuria decreases asblood glucose normalizes, but the risk may be increased whenthis therapy is used concomitantly with other medicationsthat can cause hypoglycemia, such as sulfonylureas or insu- lin. 149,150These therapies may need to be adjusted if the pa- tient’s HbA1c is already below
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	djusted if the pa- tient’s HbA1c is already below the treatment target. However, notably, SGLT2i have been studied among patients withoutT2D who have CKD in the DAPA-CKD trial (and the soon-to-be-published EMPA-KIDNEY trial) or who have heartfailure (in the DAPA-HF, EMPEROR-Reduced, andEMPEROR-Preserved trials) and did not confer any increasedrisk of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis among individuals without T2D. For patients not attaining glycemic targets, see Chapter 4 on the manag
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ining glycemic targets, see Chapter 4 on the management of hyperglycemia. Practice Point 1.3.2: The choice of an SGLT2i should pri- oritize agents with documented kidney or cardiovascularbeneﬁts and take eGFR into account. Figure 7 shows current FDA-approved doses. As SGLT2i are now indicated for kidney and heart protection, indepen- dent of their glucose-lowering effect, the labels have beenchanged to re ﬂect the studies that include patients with an eGFR>20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. Practice Point
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	th an eGFR>20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. Practice Point 1.3.3: It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or criticalmedical illness (when patients may be at greater risk for ketosis). For patients with T2D, there is a small but increased risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis with SGLT2i (see the Harmssection of Recommendation 1.3.1 for more details).chapter 1 www.kidney-international.org S46 Kidney International (2022) 102 (Suppl 5S), S1–S127 Practice Point 1.3
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	(2022) 102 (Suppl 5S), S1–S127 Practice Point 1.3.4: If a patient is at risk for hypovolemia, consider decreasing thiazide or loop diuretic dosages before commencement of SGLT2i treatment, advise patients aboutsymptoms of volume depletion and low blood pressure,and follow up on volume status after drug initiation. SGLT2i cause an initial natriuresis with accompanying weight reduction. This may contribute to one of the bene ﬁts of these drugs, namely, their con sistent reduction in risk for hear
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	mely, their con sistent reduction in risk for heart failure hospitalizations. However, there is theoreticalconcern for volume depletion and AKI, particularly among patients treated concurrently with diuretics or who have tenuous volume status. Despite this theoretical concern,clinical trials have shown that the incidence of AKI isdecreased with SGLT2i, compared with placebo. 97None- theless, caution is prudent when initiating an SGLT2i inpatients with tenuous volume status and at high risk of AK

The landmark RCTs demonstrated a reversible decrease in eGFR among those treated with an SGLT2i.151However, SGLT2i are associated with overall kidney protection withimproved albuminuria, decreased progression to severelyincreased albuminuria, and reduction of risk from worseningkidney impairment, kidney replacement therapy, or death from kidney causes. Pooled results of the 4 large RCTs that published results on kidney out
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	4 large RCTs that published results on kidney outcomes also demonstrated thatrisk of AKI is signi ﬁcantly lower with SGLT2i treatment. 97 Therefore, a modest initial drop in eGFR should not neces- sitate stopping the SGLT2i. The magnitude of initial drop in eGFR that should be clinically tolerated is not well-de ﬁned. Post hoc analyses of EMPA-REG OUTCOMES and CREDENCE suggested that a drop in eGFR $10% was not associated with increased risk or decreased bene ﬁts of empagli ﬂozin and canagli ﬂo
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	decreased bene ﬁts of empagli ﬂozin and canagli ﬂozin, respec- tively, compared with a drop in eGFR <10%.152,153In CREDENCE, a drop in eGFR $30% was uncommon (4% of participants assigned to canagli ﬂozin) but was associated with modestly increased risks of kidney adverse events. Thus, oneshould tolerate an acute eGFR decrease of #30% with initia- tion of therapy and not discontinue therapy prematurely for an acute eGFR drop within this range. If there is a >30% decline in eGFR, ensure that the p
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	there is a >30% decline in eGFR, ensure that the patient is not hypovolemic (e.g.,adjust diuretic dose), discontinue any other nephrotoxic agents,and evaluate for alternative etiologies for kidney injury. Practice Point 1.3.6: Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR fallsbelow 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, unless it is not tolerated or kidney replacement therapy is initiated. Protocols of multiple RCT s, including CREDENCE and DAPA-CKD, speci ﬁed continuati

Since these protocols provide the evidence base for use ofSGLT2i, it is prudent to follow the same approach inclinical care. Very few data are available evaluating use of SGLT2i for patients receiving dialysis, and the glucosuric actions of SGLT2i are likely insigni ﬁcant with this degree of kidney failure. Therefore, it i
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ith this degree of kidney failure. Therefore, it is reasonable to discontinuean SGLT2i prior to initiation of kidney replacementtherapy. Practice Point 1.3.7: SGLT2i have not been adequately studied in kidney transplant recipients, who may bene ﬁt from SGLT2i treatment, but are immunosuppressed and potentially at increased risk for infections; therefore, therecommendation to use SGLT2i does not apply to kidneytransplant recipients (see Recommendation 1.3.1).Research recommendations /C15Studies f

This recommendation
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	of RAS inhibitor (RASi) (2A). This recommendation places a high value on the high-quality evidence, from Finerenone in Reducing Kidney Failure andDisease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIDELIO-DKD) and Finerenone in Reducing Cardiovascular Mortality and Morbidity in Diabetic Kidney Disease (FIGARO-DKD), that ﬁnerenone, on top of ACEi or ARB treatment, slows pro- gressive loss of eGFR and decreases the risk of a cardiovascularevent among people with T2D and albuminuria. It places arelat

It places arelatively lower value on the lack of de ﬁnitive data regarding adding nonsteroidal MRA to SGLT2i (current standard of care),the risk of hyperkalemia and monitoring of potassium duringnonsteroidal MRA treatment, and the lack of observational data evaluating bene ﬁts and risks outside of the clinical trial setting. In the judgment of the Work Group, the majority of well-informed patients addressed by the recommendation wouldchapter 1 www.kidney-interna

Further, the useof steroidal MRA also increases the risk of hyperkalemia (by2–3 fold) and acute kidney injury (by 2-fold), and spi- ronolactone can cause gynecomastia. 158These adverse effects along with the report of higher incidence of hyperkalemiaafter the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study

During the time between initiation and completion of the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials, numerous rigorousclinical trials demonstrated large kidney and cardiovascular beneﬁts of SGLT2i ( Section 1.3 above), and SGLT2i became an established ﬁrst-line treatment for T2D with CKD. 143,155 Eligibility criteria for the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO- DKD trials de ﬁne a population for which an SGLT2i is now strongly indicated, and the Work Group judged that nearly allsuch patients wou

An SGLT2i was not required for entry into the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO- DKD trials, leaving some uncertainty regarding bene ﬁts of using a nonsteroidal MRA on top of SGLT2i, thoughexploratory analyses suggest that combination therapy is bothsafe and effective (Practice Point 1.4.2).

Patients with severely increased albuminuria (ACR $300 mg/g [$30 mg/mmol]), who are at high risk of CKD pro- gression and were best represented in the FIDELIO-DKD trial, might be particularly inclined to choose a nonsteroidalMRA. This recommendation also applies to people withT2D and lower levels of albuminuria (ACR 30 –299 mg/g [3–29.9 mg/mmol]), which represent a larger proportion of people with T2D with increased CVD risk but at lower

Some patients who meet current serum potassium eligibility criteria for a nonsteroidal MRA (Practice Point 1.4.3) but have ahistory of severe hyperkalemia or highly variable serum po-tassium may choose to avoid the added risk of hyperkalemia.

The costs of nonsteroidal MRA may be prohibitive, andtherefore their use may have a lower priority in low-resourcesettings, where efforts will be made to opti

Monitoring of potassium during treatment isalready indicated for patients with CKD treated with an ACEior ARB; an increased rate of hyperkalemia may lead to higher healthcare costs due to more frequent patient visits. Considerations for implementation. Nonsteroidal MRA have been most rigorously tested in patients with CKD and T2Dwith residual cardiorenal risk, as evidenced by albuminuria($30 mg/g [ $3 mg/mmol
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	as evidenced by albuminuria($30 mg/g [ $3 mg/mmol]) despite treatment with standard of care, including maximal tolerated RAS blockade, and aretherefore recommended for this population. So far, onlyﬁnerenone has demonstrated clinical cardiovascular and kidney bene ﬁts. Nonsteroidal MRA can cause hyperkalemia, and treatment dose and monitoring should be in accordancewith the clinical trials, as described in Practice Point 1.4.3.Treatment should not be initiated if serum potassium iselevated (4.8
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	t be initiated if serum potassium iselevated (4.8 mmol/l was the threshold at screening in theﬁnerenone trials, but per FDA label, serum potassium should not be >5 mmol/l). Most incidents of hyperkalemia can be managed with treatment pauses of 72 hours, as the drug has a short half-life, and if needed, general procedures to manage potassium can be applied as described in Practice Point 1.4.3. On average, there was only a small reduction in systolic blood pressure (3 mm Hg) with ﬁnerenone compare
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ic blood pressure (3 mm Hg) with ﬁnerenone compared to placebo, and no effect on HbA1c, no increase in hypo- orhyperglycemia, and no sexual side effects due to the speci ﬁcity for the MRA. 162,164Beneﬁcial effects of ﬁnerenone were similar (no signi ﬁcant heterogeneity) among participants who were also treated with SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA at baseline, and there is potentially a lower risk of hyperkalemia when ﬁner- enone is combined with an SGLT2i.165This suggests that agents could be combined, but r
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	This suggests that agents could be combined, but randomized studies have notexplicitly tested whether the bene ﬁts of these different agents are additive. Steroidal and nonsteroidal MRA should not becombined due to risk of hyperkalemia. Steroidal MRA are currently contraindicated in pregnancy. For nonsteroidal MRA, there is no experience with pregnancy, so women who are planning for pregnancy or who becomepregnant on treatment should have the drug discontinued. Rationale Adding an MRA to current

Rationale Adding an MRA to current standard of care, including ACEior ARB treatment, has been proven to be an effective strategyto reduce albuminuria in patients with diabetes and CKD. The steroidal MRA, spironolactone and eplerenone, have been shown to effectively reduce albuminuria, but datademonstrating that these MRA reduce the risk of clinicaloutcomes are not available. The more recently developednonsteroidal MRA, ﬁnerenone and esaxerenone, also reduce albuminuria, and ﬁnere

Practice Point 1.4.1: Nonsteroidal MRA are most appropriate for patients with T2D who are at high risk of CKD progressionand cardiovascular events, as demonstrated by persistentalbuminuria despite other standard-of-care therapies.www.kidney-international.org chapter 1 Kidney International (2022) 102 (Suppl 5S), S1–S127 S51 The FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trial

Patients with T2D andalbuminuria are known to be at high risk of CKD progressionand cardiovascular event

Therefore, the most logical application of ﬁnerenone is to patients with high residual risks of CKD progression and cardiovascular events, as evidenced by thepresence of albuminuria (ACR $30 mg/g [ $3 mg/mmol]) despite lifestyle modi ﬁcations and ﬁrst-line drug therapies. Practice Point

A nonsteroidal MRA can be added to a RASi and an SGLT2i for treatment of T2D and CKD. This guideline issues a strong recommendation for use of an SGLT2i in the treatment of people with T2D and CKD, positioning SGLT2i as ﬁrst-line drug therapy to prevent CKD progression and cardiovascular events regardless ofglycemia ( Figures 1 and 2). This recommendation is based on numerous clinical trials that now provide strong evidenceof ef ﬁcacy and

SGLT2i were not standard of care when the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials were initiated.However, 877 participants were using an SGLT2i at baseline,and the cardiovascular effects of ﬁnerenone, compared with placebo, appeared to be at least as bene
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	red with placebo, appeared to be at least as bene ﬁcial among people using versus not using an SGLT2i. 165It is also possible that SGLT2i may reduce the risk of hyperkalemia for patientstreated concomitantly with a RASi and nonsteroidal MRA. 165These data, combined with complementary mechanisms of action, suggest that the bene ﬁts of SGLT2i andﬁnerenone may be additive. Therefore, patients with T2D and CKD who are treated with both a RASi and anSGLT2i and meet criteria for ﬁnerenone (including r
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	GLT2i and meet criteria for ﬁnerenone (including residual albuminuria and normal serum potassium) are appropriatecandidates for treatment with ﬁnerenone ( Figure 2 ). In addition, ﬁnerenone may be added to a RASi alone for pa- tients who do not tolerate or are not candidates for an SGLT2i. 163 Practice Point 1.4.3: To mitigate risk of hyperkalemia,select patients with consistently normal serum potassiumconcentration and monitor serum potassium regularly af-ter initiation of a nonsteroidal MRA. M
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	gularly af-ter initiation of a nonsteroidal MRA. MRA are known to increase serum potassium concentra- tion and risk of hyperkalemia. To mitigate this risk, the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials restricted eligibilityto patients with normal serum potassium concentration (aftermaximizing RASi) and implemented a standardizedpotassium-monitoring protocol. These approaches yieldedacceptable rates of hyperkalemia with few attributable seriousadverse events. Speci ﬁcally, the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO- DK
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ents. Speci ﬁcally, the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO- DKD trial protocols mandated a serum potassium concen- tration consistently #4.8 mmol/l during screening. While some participants had a slightly higher serum potassium of4.9–5.0 mmol/l at randomization, selection was primarily based on a concentration #4.8 mmol/l, and patient selection in clinical practice should focus on patients who consistentlymeet this target. In the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKDtrials, serum potassium was checked 1 month after dr
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ials, serum potassium was checked 1 month after druginitiation, 4 months after drug initiation, and every 4 months thereafter. Finerenone was continued with serum potassium #5.5 mmol/l. With serum potassium >5.5 mmol/ l, the drug was temporarily withheld and serum potassiumwas rechecked within 72 hours. Use of dietary potassiumrestriction and concomitant medications, such as diureticsand dietary potassium binders, was allowed, and the drug wasreinitiated if and when potassium returned to #5.0 mm
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	nitiated if and when potassium returned to #5.0 mmol/l. Clinicians should follow a similar approach to selecting and monitoring patients for nonsteroidal MRA therapy, increasing the likelihood that the acceptable adverse-event pro ﬁle seen in the FIDELIO-DKD and FIGARO-DKD trials is maintainedwhen applied to clinical practice ( Figure 9 ).

Thus, given the preponderance of the evidence oftobacco cessation bene ﬁts reported in the general population, healthcare professionals should assess the use of tobaccoproducts and counsel patients with diabetes and CKD to quit using tobacco products.

The timeframe for thisstudy was short: 8 hours of controlled smoking versus 8hours of nonsmoking (in the same subjects) on separate days. The quality of the evidence from this study for sur- rogate outcomes was low because of very serious impre-cision (only 1 study and few participants). Critical clinicaloutcomes, such as death, kidne y failure, and cardiovascular events were not reported, and therefore the overall qualityof th

In the judgment of the Work Group, the well-documented clinical bene ﬁts of tobacco abstinence, and the availability of various interventions in nearly all settings,justify a strong recommendation. Resource use and costs. Smoking cessation strategies include behavioral interventions, pharmacotherapy, and acombination thereof. Behavioral interventions includeasse

Behavioral interventions includeassessment of tobacco use and willingness to quit, followed bycounseling during of ﬁce visits. Clinicians should present available treatment options to those who use tobacco prod- ucts and make recommendations based on cost, affordability,and availability. These include FDA-approved treatment op-tions, such as nicotine replacement therapy (patch, gums,lozenges, nasal spray, and inhalers) and medications, such asbupropion and varenicline, with appropr

In theabsence of expertise in offering smoking cessation therapy, referral to trained healthcare providers should be considered. Considerations for implementation. Assessment of tobacco use would help physicians identify high-risk individuals. Thebeneﬁts of abstinence from tobacco products are not likely to differ based on sex or race. Physicians should consideraffordability (when

Physicians should consideraffordability (when using nicotine-replacement products) andaccess to various resources while making treatment recom-mendations. Overall, these recommendations are similar to those in the KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline, the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association(AHA) guidelines on the primary prevention of CVD, 1and the US Public Health Service ’s Clinical Practice Guideline for Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence, which should facili-tate efforts
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	e and Dependence, which should facili-tate efforts at implementation. Rationale Various forms of tobacco exposure continue to contribute toexcess cardiovascular and other causes of death in multipleparts of the world. 184Population-based studies note that exposure to secondhand smoke is associated with a higherprevalence of kidney disease and the development of incident kidney disease. Although use of e-cigarettes has increased overtime, their safety, especially with regard to CVD, has beenquest
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	fety, especially with regard to CVD, has beenquestioned, and their effects on kidney disease are un- known. 185,186Although they are not recommended as a treat- ment option for those with tobacco addiction, they are beingused by adults who would like to quit smoking. A prospectivecohort study comparing the cardiovascular risk of current orformer smokers versus never smokers in diabetic patients withCKD reported a higher incidence of cardiovascular eventsamong current or prior smokers. 187Similar
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	r eventsamong current or prior smokers. 187Similar ﬁndings have also been noted in other large cohort studies wherein CKD patients who were smoking had a higher risk of cardiovascular events than did nonsmokers and former smokers. In the generalpopulation, interventions that combine pharmacotherapy andbehavioral support increase smoking cessation success. 188 Although dedicated trials are lacking in those with CKD,these interventions are likely to confer similar bene ﬁts in those with diabetes a
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	o confer similar bene ﬁts in those with diabetes and CKD. 185 Practice Point 1.5.1: Physicians should counsel patientswith diabetes and CKD to reduce secondhand smokeexposure. Secondhand smoke exposure increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular events in the general population, and associa-tions of such events with incidence of kidney disease have alsobeen reported. 180As the prevalence of smoking has decreased over time and with restrictions on using tobacco products, exposure to secondhand s

This recommendation places a higher value on the potential beneﬁts that may accrue through accurate assessment of long- term glycemic control, which in turn may maximize the bene-ﬁts and minimize the harms of glucose-lowering treatment.

HbA1c measurement is the standard of care for long-term glycemic monitoring in T1Dand T2D. Long-term glycemic monitoring allows patients to assess their diabetes control over time. Assessment of diabetes control is required to achieve glycemic targets. Glycemictargets are set to prevent diabetic complications and avoidhypoglycemia. In RCTs, targeting lower HbA1c values usingglucose-lowering medications has been proven to reduce risksof microvascular diabet

KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ardization developed speci ﬁc criteria for HbA1c analyses based upon 2 reference methods —mass spectroscopy and capillary electrophoresis with ultraviolet- visible detection. Pro ﬁciency testing data show that over 97% of assays from participating laboratories that use thesemethods provide results within 6% of the target values of theNGSP . 195HbA1c is also often measured by point-of-care in- struments, for which pro ﬁciency testing data are not suf ﬁcient to provide such assurance. Glycated alb

Glycated albumin and fructosamine have been proposed as candidates for alternative long-term glycemic monitoring. These biomarkers re ﬂect glycemia in a briefer timeframe (2 –4 weeks) than HbA1c due to their shorter survival time inblood. In observational studies, glycated albumin is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients treatedby chronic hemodialysis. 196However, compared with actual blood glucose, the glycated albumin assay is

Two systematic reviews of observational studies in patients with diabetes and CKD found that HbA1c correlatedmoderately with measures of glucose obtained by fasting ormorning blood levels, or the mean of continuous glucosemonitoring (CGM),
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	or the mean of continuous glucosemonitoring (CGM), particularly among people with aneGFR$30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. Although glycated albumin correlated with HbA1c, correlations with measures of glucose by fasting or morning blood levels or mean of CGM varied widely, from strong to no association. In most cases, corre-lations of glycated albumin with glycemia were worse thancorrelations of HbA1c with glycemia. The in ﬂuence of CKD severity on the association of glycated albumin with bloodglucose al

Correlations of fructosamine with HbA1c and mean blood glucose were examined in 4 observational studies. 196,198–200Although fructosamine correlated with HbA1c in patients with CKD, correlations with mean bloodglucose were indeterminate because of weak or absent cor-relations in advanced CKD, especially among those treate

Each review identi ﬁed 13 studies, with 3 addressing both comparisons ( Supplementary Tables S14 197,199–211and S15202,203,209,212–221) The overall quality of the studies for this recommendation was dif ﬁcult to determine due to lack of information provided fro

The WorkGroup also judged that the limitations of HbA1c, includingunderestimation or overestimation of the actual degree ofglycemic control compared to directly measured bloodglucose levels, would be important to patients. In the judg-ment of the Work Group, most but not all patients withdiabetes and CKD would choose long-term glycemic moni- toring by HbA1c desp

The recommen- dation is strong; however, some patients may choose not tomonitor by HbA1c or follow the suggested schedule oftesting, especially those with advanced CKD, anemia, ortreatment by red blood cell transfusions, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, or iron supplements.

T o the extent that HbA1c measurement aids in achieving diabetes control in patients with CKD, including those with kidney failuretreated by dialysis or kidney transplant, this recommendation islikely cost-effective, but economic analyses have not been per-formed and would be in ﬂuenced by testing frequency and consequent resource utilization and clinical outcomes.Considerations for implementation.

This recommendation is applicable to adults andchildren of all race/ethnicity groups, both sexes, and to patientswith kidney failure treated by dialysis or kidney transplant. Rationale Hyperglycemia produces glycation of proteins and othermolecular structures that eventuate in permanently glycatedforms termed advanced glycation end-products. 223HbA1c is an advanced glycation end-product of hemoglobin, a princi- ple protein in red blood cells ( Figure
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	a princi- ple protein in red blood cells ( Figure 10 ). As such, HbA1c is a long-term biomarker that re ﬂects glycemia over the lifespan of red blood cells. Notably, CKD is associated with conditionssuch as in ﬂammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic acidosis that may concurrently promote advanced glycation end-product formation in addition to hyperglycemia(Figure 10 ). 224Conversely, HbA1c is lowered by shortened survival or age of erythrocytes from anemia, transfusions, and use of erythropo

Therefore, the HbA1c measurement has low reli-ability due to assay biases and imprecision for re ﬂecting ambient glycemia in advanced CKD. HbA1c measurement is a standard of care for long-term glycemic monitoring in the general population of people with T1D or T2D, but inaccuracy

However, in the judg-ment of the Work Group, HbA1c monitoring is prudent, andmost patients would make this choice. This recommendationapplies to patients who have T1D or T2D and CKD, with thecaveat that reliability of HbA1c level for glycemic monitoringis low at more advanced CKD stages ( Figure 11 ).

In both T1D or T2D, lower achieved levels of HbA1c <7% (<53 mmol/mol) versus 8% –9% (64 –75 mmol/mol) reduce risk of overall microvascular complications, including ne-phropathy and retinopathy, and macrovascular complicationsin some RCTs. 189–193The potential harm o

No advantages of glycated albumin or fructosamine over HbA1c are known for glycemic moni-toring in CKD. Frequency of HbA1c testing is recommendedas often as 4 times per year to align with a 10 –12-week time period for which it re ﬂects ambient glycemia a
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	me period for which it re ﬂects ambient glycemia according to normal duration of red blood cell survival. In the judgmentof the Work Group, it is reasonable to test HbA1c twice peryear in many patients who are stable and achieving glycemic goals. Measuring HbA1c more frequently would be reason- able in patients with adjustments in glucose-loweringmedication, changes in lifestyle factors, or marked changesin measured blood glucose values, or those who are lessconcerned about the burden or costs o
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	who are lessconcerned about the burden or costs of more frequent lab-oratory testing. 226 Practice Point 2.1.2: Accuracy and precision of HbA1c measurement declines with advanced CKD (G4 –G5), particularly among patients treated by dialysis, in whomHbA1c measurements have low reliability. Correlations of directly measured blood glucose levels with 3 glycemic biomarkers —HbA1c, glycated albumin, and fructosamine —were progressively weaker with advanced CKD stages (G4 –G5), especially kidney fail

KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	Practice Point 2.1.3: A glucose management indicator(GMI) derived from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)data can be used to index glycemia for individuals in whomHbA1c is not concordant with directly measured blood glucose levels or clinical symptoms. CGM and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) yield direct measurements of interstitial and blood glucose, respec-tively, that are not known to be biased by CKD or its treat-ments, including dialysis or kidney transplant ( Figure 12 229). Ther
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	alysis or kidney transplant ( Figure 12 229). Therefore, if it is a clinical concern that HbA1c may be yieldingbiased estimates of long-term glycemia (e.g., discordant withSMBG, random blood glucose levels, or hypoglycemic or hy- perglycemic symptoms), it is reasonable to use CGM to generate a glucose management indicator (GMI). 228The GMI can be derived from CGM that is performed with results eitherblinded to the patients during monitoring ( “professional ” version) or available to the patient
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ofessional ” version) or available to the patient in real time. The GMI is ameasure of average blood glucose that is calculated from CGMand expressed in the units of HbA1c (%), facilitating inter-pretation of the HbA1c values. For example, if HbA1c is lower than a concurrent GMI measure, the HbA1c can be interpreted to underestimate average blood glucose by the difference inmeasurements, allowing adjustment of HbA1c targetsaccordingly. 230,231GMI may be useful for patients with advanced CKD, inc
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	may be useful for patients with advanced CKD, including those treated with dialysis, for whomreliability of HbA1c is low. It should be noted that the assay biasof HbA1c relative to GMI could potentially change over timewithin a patient, particularly when there are clinical changes that affect red blood cell turnover or protein glycation. In these situations, GMI needs to be re-established regularly. Practice Point 2.1.4: Daily glycemic monitoring with CGM or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SM

Selecting glucose-loweringagents with very low or no hypoglycemia risk should beconsidered, especially for patients who cannot perform orchoose not to perform daily blood glucose monitoring. Risk of hypoglycemia is high in patients with advanced CKD who are treated by glucose-lowering agents that raiseblood insulin levels (exogenous insulin, sulfonylureas,meglitinides). Therefore, without daily glycemic monito

This risk can be averted by using glucose-lowering agents that are notinherently associated with occurrence of hypoglycemia(metformin, SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [DPP-4] inhibitors).

CGM technology has greatly impacted diabetes self- management by providing glycemic assessment moment-to- moment, allowing patients to make real-time decisions abouttheir hyperglycemic treatment.

In the general diabetespopulation, higher HbA1c levels have been associated withincreased risk of microvascular and macrovascular compli- cations. Moreover, in clinical trials, targeting lower HbA1c levels has reduced the rates of chronic diabetes complicationsin patients with T1D 190,232–238or T2D.239–246The main harm associated with lower HbA1c targets is hypoglycemia.

KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	patients with T2D are derived mostly from studiesthat used glucose-lowering agents known to increase hypo-glycemia risk. Patients randomized to lower HbA1c levels had increased rates of severe hypoglycemia in these studies. Notably, however, lower HbA1c targets may not necessarilylead to a signi ﬁcant increase in hypoglycemia rates when attained using medications with a lower risk ofhypoglycemia. Data from RCTs support the recommendation of targeting an individualized HbA1c level of <6.5% to <8.

HbA1c targets in this range are associated with better overall survival and cardiovascular outcomes, along with decreasedincidence of moderately increased albuminuria and other microvascular outcomes, such as retinopathy. HbA1c levels inthis range may also be associated with lower risk of pro- gression to advanced CKD and kidney failure. However, the bene ﬁts of more-string

However, the bene ﬁts of more-stringent glycemic control (i.e., lower HbA1c targets) compared with less-stringentglycemic control (i.e., higher HbA1c targets) manifest overmany years of treatment. 191,248,249In addition, more- stringent glycemic control compared with less-stringentglycemic control increases the risk of hypoglycemia. 240In- dividual patient factors modify both anticipated bene ﬁts and anticipated risks of more-stringent glycemic control (Figure 14 ). For example, yo

For example, younger patients with few comorbidities, mild-to-moderate CKD, and longer life ex-pectancy may anticipate substantial cumulative long-termbeneﬁts of stringent glycemic control and therefore prefer a lower HbA1c target. Patients who are treated with medi-cations that do not cause substantial hypoglycemia, whohave preserved hypoglycemia awareness and resources to detect and intervene early in the course of hypoglycemia, and who have demonstrated an a
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	se of hypoglycemia, and who have demonstrated an ability to attain stringentHbA1c targets without hypoglycemia may also prefer a lowerHbA1c target. Patients with opposite characteristics mayprefer higher HbA1c targets. A ﬂexible approach allows each patient to optimize these tradeoffs, whereas a “one-size- ﬁts- all”single HbA1c target may offer insuf ﬁcient long-term organ protection for some patients and place others at un- due risk of hypoglycemia. Therefore, individualization of HbA1c targets

Therefore, individualization of HbA1c targets in patients with diabetes and CKD should bean interactive process that includes individual assessment ofrisk, life expectancy, disease/therapy burden, and patientpreferences.

The Work Group judged that the most important outcomes for patients related to HbA1c targets are the reduced risk of microvascular and possiblymacrovascular complications versus the increased burdenand possible harms associated with such strategies (Figure 14 ). Patients with diabetes and CKD are at higher risk of hypoglycemia with traditional glucose-loweringdrugs, and thus a single stringent target may not beappropriate for many patients. On the other hand, there iscl

On the other hand, there isclear potential for more-stringent targets to improve clini-cally relevant outcomes (all-cause mortality, cardiovascularmortality, and progression to more advanced CKD) incertain patients. Therefore, the Work Group judged that a range of targets is more suitable than a single target for all patients. In the judgment of the Work Group, all or nearlyall well-informed patients would choose an HbA1c targetwithin the recommended range, as compared to a
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	getwithin the recommended range, as compared to a more- stringent or less-stringent target. A lower HbA1c target (e.g., <6.5% or <7%) may be selected for patients for whom there are more signi ﬁcant concerns regarding onset and progression of moderately increased albuminuria and nonfatal myocardial infarction,and for patients who are able to achieve such targets easilyand without hypoglycemia (e.g., patients treated with fewerglucose-lowering agents and with agents that are less likely tocause h
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	nts and with agents that are less likely tocause hypoglycemia). A higher HbA1c target (e.g., <7.5% or<8%) may be selected for patients at higher risk for hy- poglycemia (e.g., those with low GFR and/or those treated with drugs associated with hypoglycemia, such as insulin or sulfonylureas). However, it is the Work Group ’s opinion that patients would value the use of agents with a lower risk ofhypoglycemia when possible, rather than selecting a higherHbA1c target. In addition, HbA1c targets may

In addition, HbA1c targets may also be relaxed(e.g.,<7.5% or <8%, perhaps higher in some cases) in pa- tients with a shorter life expectancy and multiple comorbid-ities. Considerations regarding life expectancy are also relevant when considering potential bene ﬁcial effects of glucose-lowering therapy. In randomized clinical trials,it has taken a number of years for bene ﬁts of intensive glycemic control to manifest as improved clinicaloutcomes. 190,191,234,245,246,248,256 Res

Lower blood glucose targets may increase costs for monitoring of blood glucose and impose anadditional burden on the patient. Use of speci ﬁc glucose- lowering agents, such as SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA, may have a greater impact on kidney and cardiovascular outcomes inpatients with T2D and CKD than on reaching speci ﬁc HbA1c targets. Considerations for implementation. The proposed HbA1c targets are applicable to all adults and chil

The suggested range for HbA1c targets does not apply to patients with kidney failure treated by dialysis; the HbA1c range in the dialysis population isunknown. Rationale HbA1c targets should be individualized, as bene ﬁts and harms of targeting speci ﬁc HbA1c levels vary according to key patient characteristics. These include patient prefer-

These include patient prefer-ences, severity of CKD, presence of comorbidities, life ex-pectancy, hypoglycemia burden, choice of glucose-loweringagent, available resources, and presence of a support system.RCTs in patients with diabetes (not speci ﬁcally recruited with CKD) suggested that the bene ﬁts and harms are rela- tively balanced at the proposed individualized HbA1c targets.

Glucose monitoring strategies that may aid in safe achievement of lower HbA1c targets include use ofCGM 257,258and SMBG, which are not known to be biased by CKD or its treatments, including dialysis or kidneytransplant (see Section 2.1 ). A GMI may be generated as a proxy for long-term glycemia in conjunction with the HbA1c measurement in

GMI maycommonly be useful for patients with advanced CKD,including those treated with dialysis, for whom the reli-ability of HbA1c is low. Practice Point 2.2.2: CGM metrics, such as time in range and time in hypoglycemia, may be considered as alterna- tives to HbA1c for de ﬁning glycemic targets in some patients. Although the accuracy and precision of HbA1c among patients wit

In addition, the accuracy and precision of HbA1care reduced among patients with CKD and an eGFR <30 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2. Thus, for some patients, CGM may be used to index HbA1c by demonstrating the association betweenme

Alternatively, CGM metrics themselves can be used to guide glucose-lowering therapy. Inparticular, glucose time in range (70 –180 mg/dl [3.9 –10.0 mmol/l]) and time in hypoglycemia ( <70 mg/dl [3.9 mmol/l] and<54 mg/dl [3.0 mmol/l]) have been used as outcomes for clinical trials 259,260and have been endorsed as appropriate metrics for clinical care.229To date, CGM me

However, due to the inherently per-sonal nature of food choice, nutrition studies are almost al-ways observational and often retrospective. In addition,intervention studies on food intake and diet are typically hardto design as blinded studies. In general,
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	lly hardto design as blinded studies. In general, subjects must buy andprepare their food, and be well-aware of what diet they arefollowing. Studies in which subjects receive weighed trays can accurately assign and track diets but are unrealistic for most study designs and subject participation. Additionally, issuessuch as study duration and long-term follow-up, sample size,compliance, reporting issues, portion size estimation, andpreparation techniques all can have dramatic effects on esti-mate
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	hniques all can have dramatic effects on esti-mated intake. The number of RCTs analyzing the effects of diet among people with diabetes and CKD is small. Most RCTs have a limited number of participants and/or examine short-term outcomes. Generalizing best diets for people with diabetesand CKD from such small sample sizes over a short period oftime does not represent the wide body of acceptable studies,which evaluate longer periods of time with large cohorts butare not RCTs. Application of large,

Application of large, multicenter studies and their results is needed in the context of diabetes, CKD, and diet. If obser- vational data and limited clinical trial data are available for large populations, it seems reasonable to use such data. If datain the general population or the broader population of peoplewith diabetes indicate that bene ﬁts result from certain eating patterns, in the absence of a strong rationale to the contrary, itseems reasonable to assume th

Practice Point 3.1.1: Patients with diabetes and CKD should consume an individualized diet high in vegetables,fruits, whole grains, ﬁber, legumes, plant-based proteins, unsaturated fats, and nuts; and lower in processed meats,reﬁned carbohydrates, and sweetened beverages.

Indeed, the complexity of creating a diet that addresses the needs of both diabetes and kidney disease may overwhelm the most dedicatedpatient. In this context, it is important to emphasize theprimary importance of maintaining a balanced diet ofhealthy foods. A focus on vegetables, fruits, whole grains,ﬁber, legumes, plant-based proteins, unsaturated fats, and nuts is common to many diets associated with good hea

In advanced CKD, potassium may need to be restricted, and people may be advised to eat lower-potassium fruits and vegetab les, and other foods. Inclu- sion of fruits and vegetables should be in line with normaldiabetic diet recommendations. Nutrition therapy can decrease HbA1c levels to levels similar to, or better than, those obtained with glucose-loweringmedications. Simple advice such as increasing intake of non-

Simple advice such as increasing intake of non- starchy vegetables, decreasing intake of added sugars and reﬁned grains, and increasing intake of whole foods over highly processed foods can be implemented for most people acrosswide geographic and economic strata ( Figure 15 ). Recommendation 3.1.1: We suggest maintaining a protein intake of 0.8 g protein/kg (weight)/d forthose with diabetes and CKD not treated with dial- ysis (2C). The WHO recommends a daily protein intake of 0.8 g/kg for hea
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ommends a daily protein intake of 0.8 g/kg for healthy people. In the judgment of the Work Group, this recommendation is reasonable in those with diabetes and CKD. Neither lower nor higher protein intake appears bene ﬁcial, and each is associated with potential harms. This recommendationapplies to patients with T1D or T2D.

Additionally, protein intake on a diabeticdiet is especially crucial to avoid episodes of hypoglycemia;limiting it in the diet may make such potentially dangerousepisodes more common. Some diets advocate protein intake greater than 0.8 g/kg/d, especially to reduce carbohydrate intake or promote weight loss. However, long-term effects of high-protein diets (espe- cially>1.0 g/kg/d) on kidney function are not known and could potentially cause

Dietary recommendations should take into accountindividual nutrition needs such as age, weight, physical ac- tivity, and comorbidities, including for those patients who may need a higher protein diet at early stages to allow for ar

Quality of evidence. The overall quality of the evidence is low. In addition to the concerns about bias exhibited in thesetrials (i.e., study limitations, imprecision, and inconsistency),the evidence is indirect, as it is derived from general diabetesand general CKD population trials.This recommendation is based upon the WHO recom- mendation for protein intake for the general population.

The quality of the evi-dence was downgraded because of imprecision and incon-sistency. 264The question whether to use a very low –protein diet combined with keto acid
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	e a very low –protein diet combined with keto acids in diabetes was not includedin the original literature review. Despite the high burden of diabetes and CKD, few studies have examined the clinical impact of diet modi ﬁcation in this patient population. An exhaustive literature search failed toshow more than weak to very weak evidence that limitingprotein intake to less than normal recommendations slowedthe progression of kidney failure or decreased mortality.

A systematic review of the literature found 11 studies on protein restriction for inclusion, but results were inconclu-sive, had little to no effect on HbA1c, or did not look at cardiovascular events or progression to kidney failure (Supplementary Table S16 265–276).

In addition, patientswith diabetes and CKD often have multiple comorbid dis-eases, such as hypertension, gout, gastropathy, mineral –bone disorders, and/or cardiac disease, which may further complicate an already complex diet regimen. Income, foodinsecurity, ability to cook and prepare food, dentition, andfamily food needs may also impact a patient ’s ability to maintain the recommended diet. Limiting or eliminatingfoods with important cultural signi ﬁcance can be deeply painful to patie

However, when a patient-centered carediscussion can occur, many individuals may willingly trade the moderation of their oral intake for the ability to avoid costly medications or unwanted side effects. In order tofollow this type of nutrition therapy, patients must learn andapply new nutrition-related behaviors.

This recommendation places a relatively higher value on evidence and recommendations from the general population, suggesting that protein intake of 0.8 g/kg/d is associated withgood outcomes. 263The recommendation places a relatively lower value on the impact of these dietary changes on qualityof life, and on the possibility that data from the generalpopulation will not apply to people with diabetes and CKD.In the judgment of t

In contrast, peoplewho are less willing or able to modify their diet for the rea-sons given above will be less inclined to follow therecommendation. Resource use and costs. Patients often would like to participate in determining what nutrition altera

Families must play a role in deciding how scarce resources will be distributed within family units.

Although most people with diabetes do not receive nutrition education, many people may see nutrition in-terventions as the least expensive and most practical way todecrease symptoms. In many situations, diet modi ﬁcationwould lower the use of expensive medications and medical interventions as HbA1c reductions from nutrition therapycan be similar to or better
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	from nutrition therapycan be similar to or better than what is expected usingcurrently available medications for T2D. Considerations for implementation. This recommendation applies to both T1D and T2D, as well as kidney transplantrecipients, but not to dialysis patients (see Practice Point3.1.2). Patients with newly diagnosed diabetes should bereferred for individualized nutrition education at diagnosis.Patients with longstanding diabetes and CKD should haveaccess to nutrition education yearly,
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	D should haveaccess to nutrition education yearly, as well as at critical timesto help build self-management skills. 277 Although most patients would be amenable to lifestyle modi ﬁcations, some may be unwilling or unable to imple- ment these and will need alternative options and substitutionsthat warrant discussions with them. These include referral topeer-counseling programs, village health workers, registereddietitians, accredited nutrition providers, or diabetes educa-tion programs. Those wi

Those with rapid decline in kidney functionespecially would warrant referral to nutrition healthcare team members. A table of protein guidelines based on 0.8 g protein/kg for adults with diabetes and CKD not requiring dialysis is foundinFigure 16 , showing the amount of protein in grams based on body weight. In patients who are signi ﬁcantly overweight, protein needs should be calculated by normalizing weight tothe median weight for height. 263Alternativ
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ight tothe median weight for height. 263Alternatively, in overweight patients, clinicians may use an ideal weight to multiply by 0.8 g protein/kg/d, rather than the patient ’s actual weight, to avoid excessively high protein intake estimation. There is noevidence to suggest that this recommendation should varybased on patient age or sex. Clinicians should advise patientsnot to confuse grams of protein per day with the weight offood in grams (i.e., 100 g of meat contains only about 25 g ofprotein
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	, 100 g of meat contains only about 25 g ofprotein; Figure 17 ). Rationale High-protein intake contributes to the development of increased intraglomerular pressure and glomerular hyper-ﬁltration, which in turn leads to glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial injury. 278Experimental models and studies in humans showed improvement in kidney function with protein restriction. In few clinical studies, predominantly enrolling those with nondiabetic and especially advancedCKD, a low-protein intake (
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	and especially advancedCKD, a low-protein intake (compared to those with normal-protein intake of 0.8 g/kg/d) has been demonstrated to slowdown the decline in kidney function. 264However, clinical trials comparing different levels of protein intake are lacking Weight (kg) Grams of protein per day (wt × 0.8 g/kg)35 2840 3250 4055 4460 4865 5270 5675 6080 6485 6890 7295 76100 80 Figure 16 | Protein guideline for adults with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) not treated with dialysis. wt, w

In addition,differences in both am

In addition,differences in both amount and type of protein intake (animal vs. vegetable), affordability, availability, and cultural factors across various countries were considered. 279Although obser- vational studies have reported that high consumption of redand processed meat is associated with increased risk of CKDprogression and mortality, fruit and vegetable intake wereassociated with decline in progression of kidney disease. 280–282 Given that these bene ﬁts have not been c
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	280–282 Given that these bene ﬁts have not been corroborated in clinical trials, the Work Group did not make any speci ﬁc recommen- dations for the type of protein intake in those with diabetes and CKD. Also, no existing evidence supports different recom-mendations based on the severity of kidney disease. Thus, thecurrent recommendation applies to all in the CKD populationnot treated with dialysis, and Practice Point 3.1.2 providesguidance for those on dialysis. Overall, these recommendationsar
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	hose on dialysis. Overall, these recommendationsare also similar to the KDIGO 2012 CKD guideline and theKidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) 2020 nutrition guidelines. 283,284 Practice Point 3.1.2: Patients treated with hemodialysis, and particularly peritoneal dialysis, should consume be-tween 1.0 and 1.2 g protein/kg (weight)/d. Dialysis has long been known to cause a catabolic response. Amino acid losses during both hemodialysis, andparticularly peritoneal dialysis, are well-doc
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	andparticularly peritoneal dialysis, are well-documented. Uremia itself causes depressed appetite, increased catabolism, and decreased muscle mass. 285Recommendations for these pa- tients are based on nitrogen balance studies, presence ofuremia, and malnutrition. 286Additionally, a slightly higher protein intake in patients with diabetes treated with dialysismay help avoid hypoglycemia, given their decreased ability forgluconeogenesis. This practice point mirrors guidance fromthe KDOQI 2020 nut
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	tice point mirrors guidance fromthe KDOQI 2020 nutrition guidelines. 284Recommendation 3.1.2: We suggest that sodium intake be <2 g of sodium per day (or <90 mmol of sodium per day, or <5 g of sodium chloride per day) in patients with diabetes and CKD (2C). This recommendation places a relatively high value on the po- tential bene ﬁt of reducing dietary sodium to 2 g of sodium per day (90 mmol of sodium per day or 5 g of sodium chloride perday) in improving blood pressure and is associated with
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	n improving blood pressure and is associated with lowercardiovascular risk for the general population. 287The recom- mendation places a relatively lower value on the impact of thesedietary changes on quality of life, and on theoretical concernsthat these bene ﬁts will not extend to people with diabetes and CKD, for example, because of impaired urinary sodium excretion. This recommendation applies to patients with T1Dor T2D. Key information Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. High sodium intake raises
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	e of bene ﬁts and harms. High sodium intake raises blood pressure and increases the risk of stroke, CVD, andoverall mortality. In the general population, sodium reduction alone or as part of other diets such as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, rich in fruits, vegetables,and low-fat dairy products, lowers blood pressure. 287,288 Population-based studies have reported that sodium con- sumption above a reference level of 2 g/d contributed to over1.65 million deaths from card

The US National Academy of Sciences group found that there was “insufﬁcient and inconsistent evidence of harmful effects of low sodium intake on type 2 diabetes, glucosetolerance, and insulin sensitivity. ”It concluded that limiting sodium intake to 1.5 –2.3 g/d was not linked to any harm, ﬁnding “insufﬁcient evidence of ad

Quality of evidence. The overall quality of the evidence was rated as low because of a reliance on indirect studies from thegeneral diabetes population that exhibit moderate quality ofthe evidence for important clinical outcomes. Fifteen relevant studies were identi ﬁed comparing low-salt versus normal-salt diets in several grou

All studies contained small numbers of patients and examined surrogate outcomes, with the quality of the evidence being low due to risk of bias andinconsistency or imprecision. “Long-term ”studies had a mean follow-up of 5 weeks, and “short-term ”studies had a mean follow-up of 6 days. Almost all studies investigating nutrition interventions in kidney disease stem from epidemiologic and/or small retro-

Very few RCTs have looked at modi ﬁcation of diet in those with diabetes and CKD. Indeed, patients with dia-betes or CKD are often excluded from such studies.

Often, due to ﬁnancial constraints, studies are limited to time periods too short to show any de ﬁnitive changes. Additionally, patients with chronic disease, required to follow a complex diet for the rest of their lives, may often regressinto old habits after extended periods of time, withoutrepeated support and intervention.The US Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality sys- tematic review recently determined that in the general pop-ulation, the strength of evide

There ismoderate to high quality of evidence for both a causal rela-tionship and an intake –response relationship between sodium and several interrelated chronic disease indicators: CVD, hy-pe

Limiting sodium intake may affect the palatability of food and the perishability or shelf life offood. In people whose sodium intake is high, a change to alower-sodium diet may require limiting their favorite foods.Individuals may, however, be willing to substitute culturallyacceptable lower-sodium alternatives to favorite foods, limittheir u

Considerations for implementation. Use of culturally appropriate food and incorporating a whole-foods diet phi- losophy may help to break the cycle of adaptation of a highlyprocessed diet to one that is more culturally appropriate,based on use of local ingredients, enabling patients and theirfamilies to avoid ﬁnancial burden and the added ﬁnancial cost of medications or kidney
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	the added ﬁnancial cost of medications or kidney replacement therapy ( Figure 19 ). However, certain strategies may require tailoring. Forexample, the DASH-type diet or use of salt substitutes, which are rich in potassium, may not be appropriate for patients with advanced CKD. There is no evidence to suggest that thisrecommendation should vary based on patient age or sex.Rationale Low sodium intake reduces blood pressure and is associatedwith improved cardiovascular outcomes in those with andwi

Patients with CKD are often salt-sensitive and unable to regulate blood pressure and extra-cellular ﬂuid volume status in the setting of high salt intake. Thus, patients with diabetes and CKD could bene ﬁt from restricting dietary salt intake. Further, lowering dietary salt improves volume status of the patient along with reducingproteinuria. 307Clinical studies have also demonstrated that dietary sodium restriction might au

Patients who are more interested in a small reduction in blood pressure and/or a lower number of anti-hypertensive medications (potentially reducing costs and therisk of s

Those who are less interested in these po-tential bene ﬁts may have more dif ﬁculty in making the requisite dietary changes, and those who ﬁnd food markedly less palatable after sodium restriction may be less inclined to follow the recommendation. The Work Group also considered the potential impact of restricting sodium intake across various countries. The GlobalBurden of Disease St

The GlobalBurden of Disease Study examined the health effects of ahigh-sodium diet in 195 countries from 1990 to 2017 andestimated that a high intake of sodium caused 3 milliondeaths and 70 million disability-adjusted life-years.

With decline in kidney function, volumeoverload is common, and hence, the recommendation can beapplied to all severities of kidney disease. The US National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recently released Dietary Reference Intakes for So- dium and Potassium, 289which indicates at least moderate strength of evidence for both cau

For those wit

For those with intakes above 2300 mg, the recommendation is to decrease intake. ”Larger effects in blood pressure reduction were seen in people with hypertension, butthe bene ﬁts of sodium reduction were deemed to be appli- cable to both normotensive and hypertensive people. Inagreement with the WHO, the Work Group judged that so-dium intake should be restricted to <2 g/d, which although above 1.5 g/d, is less than 2.3 g/d and much less than theaverage intake
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	than 2.3 g/d and much less than theaverage intake (4 –5 g/d). 308 Practice Point 3.1.3: Shared decision-making should be a cornerstone of patient-centered nutrition management inpatients with diabetes and CKD. Modifying dietary intake is a long and complex process. Patients with diabetes and CKD often have other chroniccomorbidities. Nutrition therapies may need to be coordi-nated to allow for patient-centered solutions, including recognition of differences in individuals such as age, denti- ti
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	differences in individuals such as age, denti- tion, cultural food preferences, ﬁnances, and patient goals, and to help align their often-con ﬂicting comorbid nutrition requirements. Application of patient-centered care models has shown increased adherence and increased quality of life for par-ticipants. Particularly in areas of diabetic self-management,and nutrition therapy, when patients are able to give input and offer their own solutions, outcomes are more positive for both patient and prov
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	tcomes are more positive for both patient and provider. 309Patient-centered care models include patient problem-solving, allowing patientsto select strategies they feel will be successful for them,supporting patients as they work through issues, supportingself-ef ﬁcacy and self-con ﬁdence, and incorporating self- selected behavioral goal setting. A recognition thatbehavior change takes 2 –8 months and that patients will fail many times before they succeed is part of the process. Involvement and
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	y succeed is part of the process. Involvement and education of the patients ’families and/or caregivers are also highly desirable. Care must becollaborative, involving all providers, including the primary care provider, and allow for informed decision-making bypatients and often their families. Practice Point 3.1.4: Accredited nutrition providers, regis- tered dietitians and diabetes educators, community healthworkers, peer counselors, or other health workers shouldbe engaged in the multidiscipl
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ealth workers shouldbe engaged in the multidisciplinary nutrition care of pa-tients with diabetes and CKD. Recognizing that changing dietary habits and intake is a long and complex process, patients need repeated access tohealthcare providers who can provide information, based on the best adult education techniques available. This access will allow patients to make informed decisions about theirnutritional intake, using shared decision-making techniques.It is quite possible that the physician in
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	hniques.It is quite possible that the physician in these situations hasneither the time, nor the expertise, to help with detailedrepeated modi ﬁcation of the patient ’s diet. These interactions often require complex reporting techniques by the patient, atleast an estimated nutritional analysis by the provider, and proposed options, which the patient will need to try and then accept or discard. After trial, the patient must be able to re-turn and discuss other options if the original strategies w
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	discuss other options if the original strategies werenot satisfactory. In more sophisticated healthcare systemswith accredited providers, these should be the ﬁrst point of reference. In these cases, referral to a diabetes educator,registered dietician nutritionist, international nutrition-credentialed professional, or community health nurse would be desirable. As healthcare systems vary around the world, in areas where accredited nutrition providers are scarce or nonexis-tent, effort should be p

Patients whohave decreased health literacy will require more time spent in an education session with healthcare providers, be they village healthcare workers, telehealth providers, physicians, nurses,international nutrition-credentialed professionals, or
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	rnational nutrition-credentialed professionals, or regis-tered dietitian nutritionists. In situations in which such nutrition education pro- fessionals are unavailable or unaffordable, other modes ofpatient support should be investigated. Peer counselors,village, or community healthcare workers trained to identify appropriate healthy alternatives, telemedicine systems, or mobile phone applications can be valuable contributors to thecare of patients with diabetes and CKD, particularly in un-derse

When possible, technology can be used to enhance the patient ’s ability to learn and utilize information. Increased availability of nutrition applications for use on mobile de-vices, the use of social media, and more readily available nutrient database information, along with education about how to access and utilize these technologies, will helpempower patients.www.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidney International (2022) 102 (S

This recommendation places a high value on the well- documented health and economic bene ﬁts of regular physical ac

The recommendation places alower value on the lack of direct evidence for bene ﬁt in people with diabetes and CKD speci ﬁcally. This recommendation ap- plies to patients with T1D or T2D.

KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	th bene ﬁts of engaging in regular physical activity are well-known.1,311 Patients with diabetes and CKD have lower levels of phys- ical activity, along with reduced overall ﬁtness levels, as compared to the general population.312In fact, over two- thirds of adults with CKD in the US do not meet the phys-ical activity levels recommended by the AHA and theAmerican College of Sports Medicine. 312,313In both the general population and those with CKD, lower levels ofphysical activity and physical ﬁt
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	, lower levels ofphysical activity and physical ﬁtness are associated with pro- gressively higher risks of ASCVD and mortality. 314,315Despite these known associations, very few clinical trials have exam- ined the impact of different exercise programs and imple- mentation of routine physical activity in people with diabetesand CKD. 311,316,317In the general population and those with diabetes, improvement in physical activity levels offers car-diometabolic, kidney, and cognitive bene ﬁts. 1,311,3

Similar bene ﬁts are anticipated in those with diabetes and CKD who engage in physical activity regularly. 319However, CKD patients are often older and are at increased risk of falls.320They also have functional limita- tions, which might preclude participating in regular exerciseand high-

Evidence supporting ph
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	1–S127 Quality of evidence. Evidence supporting physical activity in people with CKD stems from epidemiologic and/or smallsingle-center prospective studies. Very few clinical trialshave examined the impact of supervised exercise training onkidney disease progression and CVD in people withCKD. 324 RCTs that have examined exercise interventions in patients with diabetes and CKD have been of insuf ﬁcient duration to examine critical clinical outcomes such as death, kidneyfailure, and cardiovascular

The quality of the evidence forRCTs comparing aerobic and resistance training interventionsin combination with diet, versus with diet alone, was lowbecause of study limitations (unclear blinding of outcomeassessors) and imprecision (only 1 study; Supplementary Tables S21 andS22 325,326) One trial compared aerobic exer- cise along with standard of care to standard of care/medicalmanagem

The quality of the evidence was low due tostudy limitations (unclear blinding of participants/in-vestigators and outcome assessors) and imprecision (only 1study) for critical outcomes and blood pressure. The qualityof evidence was also very low for kidney function outcomesbecause of risk of bias and very serious imprecision (only 1 study had very wide con ﬁdence intervals indicating appre- ciable bene ﬁt and harm) ( Supplementary Tables

The Work Group also judged that recommendingphysical activity to patients during routine clinical visitsdespite competing issues that must be addressed during of ﬁce visits would be important to patients. In the judgment of theWork Group, the well-documented clinical and economicbeneﬁts of physical activity, as well as the relative lack of speciﬁc resou

Resource use and costs. Implementation of interventions to improve physical activity (such as walking, running, biking,etc.) is feasible even in countries with limited resources andis potentially cost-effective. 327In high-income countries, engaging in structured exercise programs such as aerobic andres
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	tructured exercise programs such as aerobic andresistance training might be feasible and can be adopted basedon availability and affordability. Considerations for implementation. Assessment of baseline physical activity levels and their physical tolerance would help physicians identify high-risk populations and seek assistancefrom other healthcare team members (exercise therapists,other specialists, etc.) to provide appropriate guidance tohigh-risk patients. Patients with diabetes and CKD who ar

Patients with diabetes and CKD who are athigher risk of adverse events (such as falls during vigorousphysical activity) and those with pre-existing CVD shouldconsult their healthcare providers before engaging in high- intensity activities. Bene ﬁts of engaging in routine physical activity are similar among men and women and are unlikelyto differ based on race or ethnicity. Overall, these recom-mendations are similar to the KDIGO 2012 CKD guide-lines 283and the recently released ACC/
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	CKD guide-lines 283and the recently released ACC/AHA guidelines on the primary prevention of CVD,1which should facilitate efforts at implementation. Rationale Physical activity de ﬁned as bodily movement produced by the skeletal muscle requires energy expenditure and is usuallyperformed throughout the day. Depending on the energy expenditure, physical activity is classi ﬁed into light-, moder- ate-, and vigorous-intensity activities ( Figure 20 313). Data from the WHO indicate that the global a

Data from the WHO indicate that the global age- standardized prevalence of insuf ﬁcient physical activity was 27.5%, and the 2025 global physical activity target (a 10%relative reduction in insuf ﬁcient physical activity) will not be met based on the current trends of physical activity, thus Intensity of physical activityExamples METS Sedentary LightModerateVigorousSitting, watching television, reclining Slow walking, household work such as cooking, cleaningBrisk walking, biking, yoga, swi

Further, loss of muscle mass and development of complications such as anemia might limit the functional capacity of these patients askidney function continues to decline. 321Notably, over two- thirds of adults with CKD do not meet the mini
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	wo- thirds of adults with CKD do not meet the minimum rec-ommended goal of physical activity (450 –750 metabolic equivalents [METs]/min/wk) ( Figure 21 ). 312,313This situation worsens as kidney function declines, which per se leads to reduced functional capacity. To further complicate this, sedentary behavior is common in CKD with over two-thirds of daylight time spent being sedentary (approximately 40min/h). 313Sedentary behavior is de ﬁned as any behavior characterized by an energy expenditur
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	any behavior characterized by an energy expenditure <1.5 METs while in a sitting or reclined position and is associated with a higher riskof hospitalization and death in the general population. 329 Physical activity improves insulin sensitivity, lowers inﬂammatory markers, and improves endothelial func- tion.330–332These, in turn, are associated with an improve- ment in CVD and all-cause mortality in the generalpopulation and those with kidney disease. 322Higher levels of physical activity are f

KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ty was associated with increased mortality risk in CKDand non-CKD populations. 334Further, a tradeoff of lower sedentary duration with higher light-activity duration wasassociated with a lower hazard of death in the CKD subgroup(hazard ratio [HR]: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.35 –0.98). Cumulatively,evidence from observational studies suggests numerous health bene ﬁts of physical activity in those with kidney dis- ease. 311However, clinical trials examining the bene ﬁts of physical activity and exercise in t
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	he bene ﬁts of physical activity and exercise in those with CKD are limited.326The Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) study, a large multicenter RCT, demonstrated that an inten-sive lifestyle modi ﬁcation that increased the physical activity to 175 min/wk did not confer cardiovascular bene ﬁts among overweight/obese adults with T2D. 335However, in a second- ary analysis of this trial, investigators examined the impact ofintensive lifestyle modi ﬁcation on development of very high- risk C

Intervention reduced the incidence of the very high-risk category of CKD by 31%, suggesting that thereare long-term bene ﬁts of lifestyle changes in those with dia- betes and at risk for CKD. 335 Practice Point 3.2.1: Recommendations for physical activity should consider a
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	mendations for physical activity should consider age, ethnic background, presence of other comorbidities, and access to resources. Older adults often have dif ﬁculty and restrictions in per- forming certain types of activities. These stem from thepresence of other chronic comorbid conditions such as pe-ripheral neuropathy, and osteoarthritis, which pose limita-tions for certain types of exercise. Therefore, physicians andhealthcare providers should ﬁrst assess the baseline activity level and the

CKD patients are often sedentary, which is associated with an increased risk of mortality.313In addition, they have limited exercise tolerance and may not able to do longerperiods of exercise. Thus, patients with CKD should be encouraged to do many short bouts of exercise (less in- tensity), as they still offer health ben

Recent data indicate that the accumulated amount of activity over a week is critical(i.e., even shorter bouts of activities over the course of a weekyield clinical bene ﬁts similar to those accomplished with intense physical activity). 1Thus, when possible, activity should be spread throughout the week to maximize bene ﬁts. Practice Point 3.2.3: For patients at higher risk of falls, healthcare providers should provide advice on the intensi
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	are providers should provide advice on the intensityof physical activity (low, moderate, or vigorous) and thetype of exercises (aerobic vs. resistance, or both). In those with CKD, sarcopenia is common and is related to adverse outcomes. Patients should engage in multicomponentphysical activities, which include aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities along with balance-training activities as tolerated ( Figure 22 ). 339Beneﬁts of muscle strengthening are often underappreciated. They promote
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	gthening are often underappreciated. They promote weight maintenance andmaintenance of lean body mass while a person is attempting tolose weight. These bene ﬁts can vary, and some patients may not perform certain types of exercises. Hence, recommendations forintensity and type of activity should be individualized based on their age, comorbid conditions, and activity status at baselinealso. Depending on the availability of resources, referral to aphysical activity specialist to provide guidance a
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	physical activity specialist to provide guidance about the type and amount of exercise can be considered. Practice Point 3.2.4: Physicians should consider advising/ encouraging patients with obesity, diabetes, and CKD tolose weight, particularly patients with eGFR ‡30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. Obesity (de ﬁned by body mass index [BMI] >30 kg/m2)i s an independent risk factor for kidney disease progression and CVD.340Among Asian populations, having a BMI >27.5 kg/ m2increases the risk for adverse outc

With an eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and kidney failure treated with dialysis, patients may spontaneously reduce di- etary intake, and malnutrition and muscle-wasting are po- tential concer

Lifestyle therapy is the cornerstone of management for patients with T2D an
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	cornerstone of management for patients with T2D and CKD. In addition, metformin and SGLT2i should be used in combination as ﬁrst-line treatment for most patients with suitable eGFR ( Figures 23 and 25). SGLT2i are recommended as part of comprehensive care ofpatients with T2D and eGFR $20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 because they have been proven to reduce risks of CKD pro- gression and major CVD events, especially heart failure (seeSection 1.3 ). These bene ﬁts of SGLT2i do not appear to be mediated by g
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ne ﬁts of SGLT2i do not appear to be mediated by glycemia. Nonetheless, SGLT2i do also lower blood glucose, with improvements in HbA1c that are modestand diminished at low eGFR. Similarly, metformin is aneffective, safe, and inexpensive medication for ﬁrst-line treatment of T2D when eGFR is >30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 (seeSection 4.1 ). Therefore, a combination of metformin and SGLT2i is a logical foundation for glycemic control in suitablepatients with T2D. Additional glucose-lowering drugs can be

The combination of metformin and anSGLT2i is logical because they have different mechanisms ofaction, and neither carries increased risk of hypoglycemia.Even when glycemic targets are achieved on metformin, anSGLT2i should be added in these patients for the bene ﬁcial effect on CKD progression and CVD risk (see Section 1.3 ). For patients with T2D, CKD, and an eGFR $30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2not currently t

Given the historical role of metformin as the initial drug treatment for T2D, and the factthat most patients in cardiovascular outcome trials treated with SGLT2i were ﬁrst treated with metformin, it is logical to initiate metformin ﬁrst for most patients, with
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	to initiate metformin ﬁrst for most patients, with the anticipa- tion that SGLT2i should be added soon after. Whensequencing multiple bene ﬁcial therapies, it is critical to ensure timely follow-up and institution of step-wise plans, avoidingtreatment inertia (see Chapter 1). Initial combination therapyis also a reasonable option when education and monitoringfor multiple potential adverse effects are feasible.

Forpatients who have little or no need for pharmacologic agentsto control glycemia, or who cannot tolerate metformin,treatment with an SGLT2i alone is reasonable in order toreduce risks of CKD progression and CVD events.

Some patients with T2D will not achieve glycemic targets with lifestyle therapy, metformin, and SGLT2i, or they willnot be able to use these interventions due to intolerances, loweGFR,

Glucose-lowering agents otherthan metformin and SGLT2i will likely be needed in these situations. GLP-1 RA are generally preferred because of theirdemonstrated cardiovascular bene ﬁts, particularly among patients with established ASCVD even with eGFR <60 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2,346and their bene ﬁts of reducing albumin- uria and slowing eGFR decline (see Section 4.3).346,347Other classes of glucose-lowering agents may also be

This recommendation places a high value on the ef ﬁcacy of metformin in lowering HbA1c level, its widespread availabilityand low cost, its good safety pro ﬁle, and its potential bene ﬁts in weight gain prevention and cardiovascular protection.

Key information Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. Metformin is an effective antiglycemic agent and has been shown to be effective inreducing HbA1c in patients with T2D, with low risks forhypoglycemia in both the general population and patients with CKD. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) showed that metformin monotherapy in obeseindividuals achieved s

The UKPDS study suggested that among patientsallocated to intensive blood glucose control treatment, met- formin had a greater effe

However, a second study that had examined MACE outcomes with metformin use suggested that metformin treatment was associated with a slightlylower readmission rate for congestive heart failure (HR:0.91; 95% CI: 0.84 –0.99). The signal for heart protection in the CKD cohort appears to be poor; the lackluster quality ofthe evidence and the observational nature of the studies inthis population preclude any de ﬁnitive conclu

Dose adjustments of metformin are required with a decline in the eGFR, and thereare currently no safety data for metformin use in patients withan eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2or in those who are on dialysis. Patients will, therefore, need to be switched offmetformin when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. These practical is

Rationale This recommendation places a higher value on the manypotential advantages of metformin use in the general popu-lation, which include its ef ﬁcacy in lowering HbA1c, its beneﬁts in weight reduction and cardiovascular protection, its good safety pro ﬁle, the general familiarity with the drug, its widespread availability and low cost; and a lower value on thelack of evidence that metformin ha
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	wer value on thelack of evidence that metformin has any kidney protective effects or mortality bene ﬁts. This is a strong recommendation, as the Work Group judged that metformin would likely be the initial drug ofchoice for all or nearly all well-informed patients, due to itswidespread availability and low cost, especially in low-resource settings. The Work Group also judged that the ma-jority of physicians, if not all, will be comfortable in initiatingmetformin treatment due to familiarity with
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	tiatingmetformin treatment due to familiarity with this drug, and its good safety pro ﬁle. Practice Point 4.1.1: Treat kidney transplant recipients with T2D and an eGFR ‡30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2with metformin according to recommendations for patients with T2D andCKD. The data for the use of metformin after kidney trans- plantation are less robust. Most of the evidence was derived from registry and pharmacy claims data, which showed that the use of metformin was not associated with worse patient or
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	metformin was not associated with worse patient orallograft survival. 367One such analysis even suggested that metformin treatment after kidney transplantation wasassociated with signi ﬁcantly lower all-cause, malignancy- related, and infection-related mortality.368The Transdiab study was a pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled trial thatrecruited 19 patients with impaired glucose tolerance after kidney transplantation from a single center, and examined the efﬁcacy and tolerability of metformin
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	xamined the efﬁcacy and tolerability of metformin treatment. 369Although there were no adverse signals from the trial, the number ofpatients recruited was unfortunately too small for anyconclusive recommendations. In view of the lack of dataagainst the use of metformin after transplantation, it is thejudgment of the Work Group that the recommendation formetformin use in the transplant population be based on the eGFR, using the same approach as for the CKD group. Practice Point 4.1.2: Monitor eGF
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	r the CKD group. Practice Point 4.1.2: Monitor eGFR in patients treated with metformin. Increase the frequency of monitoring when theeGFR is <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2(Figure 27 ). Given that metformin is excreted by the kidneys and there is concern for lactic acid accumulation with a decline inkidney function, it is important to monitor the eGFR at least annually when a patient is on metformin treatment. The frequency of monitoring should be increased to every 3 –6 months as the eGFR drops below 6
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	sed to every 3 –6 months as the eGFR drops below 60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, with a view to decreasing the dose accordingly. Practice Point 4.1.3: Adjust the dose of metformin when the eGFR is <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2, and for some pa- tients when the eGFR is 45 –59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (Figure 27 ). Figure 27 provides a suggested approach in adjusting the dose for metformin in accordance to the decline in kidneyfunction: /C15For an eGFR of 45 –59 ml/min per 1.73 m2, dose reduction may be considered in
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	per 1.73 m2, dose reduction may be considered in the presence of conditions that pre-dispose patients to hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. /C15The maximum dose should be halved when the eGFR de- clines to 30 –45 ml/min per 1.73 m2. /C15Treatment should be discontinued when the eGFR declines to<30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, or when the patient is initiated on dialysis, whichever is earlier. Practice Point 4.1.4: Monitor patients for vitamin B12 deﬁciency when they are treated with metformin for more than 4
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	n they are treated with metformin for more than 4 years. Metformin interferes with intestinal vitamin B12 absorp- tion, and the NHANES found that biochemical vitamin B12deﬁciency was noted in 5.8% of patients with diabetes on metformin, compared to 2.4% ( P¼0.0026) of those not on metformin, and 3.3% ( P¼0.0002) of patients without dia- betes. 370One study randomized patients with T2D on insulin to receive metformin or placebo and examined the develop-ment of vitamin B12 de ﬁciency over a mean f

However, clinical con-sequences of vitamin B12 de ﬁciency with metforminchapter 4 www.kidney-international.org S80 Kidney International (2022) 102 (Suppl 5S), S1–S127 treatment are uncommon, and it is the judgment of the Work Group that routine concurrent supplementation with vitami
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	hat routine concurrent supplementation with vitaminB12 is unnecessary. In addition, the study demonstrated thatthe reduction in vitamin B12 concentration is increased withincreasing duration of metformin therapy. Monitoring ofvitamin B12 levels should be considered in patients who have been on long-term metformin treatment (e.g., >4 years) or in those who are at risk of low vitamin B12 levels (e.g., patientswith malabsorption syndrome, or reduced dietary intake[vegans]).

The other agents(lixisenatide, exenatide, and oral semaglutide) have beenshown to have cardiovascular safety, but without signi ﬁcant effects on cardiovascular risk reduction. The LEADER trial (evaluating liraglutide) included 9340 individuals with T2D and HbA1c $7% with high card

The LEADER trial compared once-daily liraglutide to placebo and followed participants fora median of 3.8 years for primary MACE outcome of car-diovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. There was a 13% reduction in
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	or nonfatal stroke. There was a 13% reduction in MACE (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.78 –0.97) conferred by liraglutide. In the LEADER trial, the risk reduction for the primary composite MACE outcome was even greater among in-dividuals with CKD G3a or greater severity (eGFR <60 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2) compared to those with an eGFR $60 ml/ min per 1.73 m2(HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.57 –0.85 vs. HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.83 –1.07, respectively, P-interaction ¼0.01).384This beneﬁt was seen across each separate cardiovasc

Notably, liraglutide (compared to placebo) conferred animpressive 49% reduction for nonfatal stroke, with HR: 0.51(95% CI: 0.33 –0.80) for eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 versus HR: 1.07 (95% CI: 0.84 –1.37) for eGFR $60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Although subgroup analyses should be consid- ered cautiously, these ﬁndings suggest that ef ﬁcacy among individuals with CKD is at least as great as that for those without CKD. The SUSTAIN-6 trial (

The SUSTAIN-6 trial (evaluating injectable semaglutide) enrolled 3297 patients with T2D and HbA1c $7% with CVD, CKD G3 or higher, or age $60 years with at least 1 major CVD risk factor.374A total of 83% of participants had CVD, CKD, or both, with 10.7% having CKD only and 13.4% having bothCKD and CVD. SUSTAIN-6 found that once-weekly sem- aglutide compared to placebo reduced the primary compositeMACE outcome by 26% (HR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.58 –0.95). In subgroup analysis
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	R: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.58 –0.95). In subgroup analysis, there was no evidence of effect heteroge- neity by CKD subgroup, with similar MACE reduction for those with an eGFR <30 ml/min per 1.73 m 2versus$30 ml/ min per 1.73 m2(P-interaction ¼0.98) and similar reduction for those with an eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2versus$60 ml/min per 1.73 m2(P-interaction ¼0.37).

HARMONY found that albiglutide (dosed once weekly) compared to placebo reduced the pri-mary MACE outcome (cardiovascular death, myocardialinfarction, or stroke) over a median duration of follow-up of1.6 years in the overall cohort by 22% (HR: 0.78; 95% CI:0.68–0.90). There was no signi ﬁcant heterogeneity of treat- ment bene ﬁt for the primary cardiovascular outcome among the eGFR subgroups o

At this time, albiglutide is currently not available on the market, so this is not an option for patients. The REWIND trial (evaluating dulaglutide) included 9901 adults with T2D with HbA1c of #9.5% (with no lower limit and mean HbA1c of 7.2%).372,377An eGFR <15 ml/min per 1.73 m2was an exclusion criterion. The REWIND trial enrolled a low propo

The REWIND trial enrolled a low proportion of patients with established CVD (31.5%); thus, it is largely considered a primary prevention trial. The REWIND trial also included a signi ﬁcant number of individuals with CKD. Over a median follow-up of 5.4 years,the primary MACE outcome (composite endpoint of nonfatalmyocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or CVD death) was12% lower with once-weekly dulaglutide compared to pla-cebo (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79 –0.99).

The reduction in pri- mary cardiovascular outcome was similar among those with versus without previous CVD ( P-interaction ¼0.97). The AMPLITUDE-O trial studied the cardiovascular safety of efpeglenatide in 4076 patients with T2D and high cardio-vascular risk or CKD, including 89.6% with established CVD.Efpeglenatide was superior to placebo for the primary MACEoutcome, with HR for the primary outcome of 0.73 (95% CI:0.58–0.92), and comparable MACE risk reduction in part

Furthermore, there was no difference in theprimary outcome for participants with an eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2versus$60 ml/min per 1.73 m2(P-interaction ¼ 0.80), with HR for primary outcome of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.41 – 1.33) for those with an eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. A 2021 meta-analysis of the 8 trials of GLP-1 RA (ELIXA, LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, EXSCEL, HARMONY, REWIND
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	(ELIXA, LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, EXSCEL, HARMONY, REWIND,PIONEER 6, and AMPLITUDE-O), which together includeda total of 60,080 participants, evaluated pooled cardiovascularand kidney outcome data in participants with T2D, includingthose with CKD. 346Compared to placebo, GLP-1 RA treat- ment conferred a reduction in cardiovascular death (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.80 –0.94), stroke (HR: 0.83; 95% CI: 0.76 – 0.92), myocardial infarction (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.83 –0.98), all-cause mortality (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.8
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	–0.98), all-cause mortality (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.82 –0.94), and hos- pitalization for heart failure (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.83 –0.98). Of note, this is the ﬁrst time a bene ﬁt for heart failure hos- pitalization has been demonstrated for the GLP-1 RA class ofmedications. Kidney outcomes. The LEADER trial also examined the effects of liraglutide compared to placebo on a prespeci ﬁed secondary composite kidney outcome (new-onset severelyincreased albuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, kidneyfailu

There was no difference between liraglutide and placebo in serum creati-nine or kidney failure, and few deaths attributed to kidneydisease occurred in the study. In the SUSTAIN-6 trial, t
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	e occurred in the study. In the SUSTAIN-6 trial, there was also a reduction in new or worsening nephropathy with semaglutide compared toplacebo (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.46 –0.88). 374This composite kidney outcome was de ﬁned as persistent severely increased albuminuria, persistent doubling of serum creatinine, a creatinine clearance of <45 ml/min, or need for kidney replacement therapy. The REWIND trial also examined dulaglutide ’s bene ﬁto n CKD as a component of the secondary microvascularoutcome.
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	a component of the secondary microvascularoutcome. 372,377There was a 15% reduction in the composite kidney outcome de ﬁned as new severely increased albumin- uria (ACR of >33.9 mg/mmol [ >339 mg/g]), sustained eGFR decline of 30% from baseline, or use of kidney replacement therapy with dulaglutide compared to placebo (HR: 0.85;95% CI: 0.77 –0.93). Similar to other GLP-1 RA trials, the strongest evidence for bene ﬁt was for new severely increasedalbuminuria (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.68 –0.87). Notabl
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	albuminuria (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.68 –0.87). Notably, in post hocexploratory analyses, eGFR decline thresholds of 40% and 50% were signi ﬁcantly reduced by 30% and 46%, respectively. Of course, exploratory results must be interpreted cautiously and regarded as hypothesis-generating. There were no serious adverse events for kidney disease in the REWIND trial.Among the 9901 participants, 22.2% had an eGFR <60 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2at baseline, and 7.9% had severely increased albuminuria. The bene ﬁt
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	% had severely increased albuminuria. The bene ﬁt on the composite kidney outcome was similar among those with an eGFR $60 ml/min per 1.73 m2or<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2(P-interaction ¼0.65), and among subgroups de ﬁned by baseline albuminuria status and use of an ACEi or ARB. Of note, the HbA1c-lowering and blood pressure –lowering effects explained 26% and 15%, respectively, of the kidney bene ﬁts conferred by dulaglutide. Hence, not all of the bene ﬁt of GLP-1 RA can be explained by improvement i
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	e ﬁt of GLP-1 RA can be explained by improvement in the conventional CKD risk factors. Another important study that supports a potential kidney beneﬁt and emphasizes the safety of a GLP-1 RA for glycemic control in the CKD population was the Assessment of Weekly Administration of LY2189265 (Dulaglutide) in Diabetes 7 (AWARD-7) trial, which compared dulaglutide to insulinglargine among patients with moderate-to-severe CKD. 382 Although glycemic indices were the primary outcome of thetrial, kidney
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	dices were the primary outcome of thetrial, kidney outcomes (eGFR and ACR) were the main sec-ondary outcomes. AWARD-7 enrolled patients with T2D andCKD G3a –G4 (mean eGFR 38 ml/min per 1.73 m 2) who were being treated with an ACEi or ARB and found that dulaglu- tide conferred signi ﬁcantly less eGFR decline over 52 weeks (mean: –3.3 ml/min per 1.73 m2vs.–0.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2) with either a lower dose (0.75 mg weekly) or higher dose (1.5mg weekly) of dulaglutide, respectively, compared to insul
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	y) of dulaglutide, respectively, compared to insulinglargine. The bene ﬁts on eGFR were most evident in the severely increased albuminuria subgroup (mean: –5.5 ml/min per 1.73 m 2vs.–0.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2and–0.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2over 52 weeks) with the lower and higher doses of dulaglutide, respectively. These bene ﬁts were accomplished with similar improvement in HbA1c (mean 1%) and com-parable blood pressure levels between the dulaglutide andinsulin glargine groups. Notably, rates of symptom
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	insulin glargine groups. Notably, rates of symptomatic hy-poglycemia were reduced by half with dulaglutide comparedto insulin glargine. Although there were the expected higherrates of gastrointestinal side effects, the overall safety pro ﬁle of dulaglutide was con ﬁrmed in CKD G3a –G4. As a result, dulaglutide has received FDA approval for glycemic control in T2D with eGFR as low as 15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. In a pre- speciﬁed exploratory analysis of AWARD-7, risk for 40% eGFR decline or kidney fa
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	of AWARD-7, risk for 40% eGFR decline or kidney failure treated by dialysis or kidneytransplant was reduced by more than half, and in those withmacroalbuminuria, the relative risk for this outcome wasreduced by 75% (HR: 0.25; 95 % CI: 0.10 –0.68). 385 In the 2021 meta-analysis, 8 cardiovascular outcomes trials (ELIXA, LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, EXSCEL, HARMONY, REWIND, PIONEER 6, and AMPLITUDE-O), GLP-1 RAtreatment reduces risk for a broad composite kidney outcome(development of new severely increased a

Excluding severely increased albuminuria, the as-sociation of GLP-1 RA with worsening kidney function didnot achieve statistical signi ﬁcance, but the signal points to- ward bene ﬁt (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.72 –1.02). A major limitation is that results have not been reported from a clinical trial enrolling a study population selected forCKD or in which kidney outcomes were the primary out- comes. However, a clinical trial of GLP-1 RA with a primary kidney disease outcome is

Some patients may not wish to take an injectable medication. There is currently 1 FDA-approved oral GLP-1 RA (semaglutide). Side effects of GLP-1 RA may preclude use of a GLP-1 RA in some patients. There is ri

The gastroin-testinal side effects are dose-dependent and may vary acrossGLP-1 RA formulations. 387There also might be injection-site reactions and an increase in heart rate with this therapy, and GLP-1 RA should be avoided in patients at risk for thyroid C- cell (medullary thyroid) tumors and with a history of acutepancreatitis.

KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	tis. Exenatide and lixisenatide are not recommended at low eGFR, and given that the ELIXA 381and EXSCEL376,378trials did not prove any cardiovascular bene ﬁt with these agents, the priority is to use one of the other available GLP-1 RA,which have shown CVD and CKD bene ﬁts (i.e., liraglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide). Notably, effects of GLP-1 RA on cardiovascular and CKD outcomes appear not to beentirely mediated through improved risk factors. Treatmentwith GLP-1 RA may be used for kidney
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	rs. Treatmentwith GLP-1 RA may be used for kidney and heartprotection as well as to manage hyperglycemia. Initiation of a GLP-1 RA must take into account other glucose-loweringagents, especially those associated with hypoglycemia, whichmay require changes to these medications. Of note, in the largest meta-analyses conducted to date with 8 GLP-1 RA trials including 60,080 participants, there were noincreased risks of hypoglycemia, pancreatitis, or pancreaticcancer. 346 Although GLP-1 RA and SGLT2
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	pancreaticcancer. 346 Although GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i reduce MACE to a similar degree, GLP-1 RA may be preferred for ASCVD, whereasthere is currently stronger evidence for SGLT2i for reductionin heart failure and CKD progression. For patients with T2D, CKD, and an eGFR $20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, SGLT2i agents are preferred over GLP-1 RA as initial kidney and heartprotective agents. However, in light of the aforementionedbeneﬁcial effects of GLP-1 RA on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	on cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with T2D, GLP-1 RA are an excellentaddition for patients who have not achieved their glycemictarget or as an alternative for patients unable to toleratemetformin and/or an SGLT2i. GLP-1 RA may also be useful for reducing albuminuria. GLP-1 RA are contraindicated for patients with a history of medullary thyroid cancer or with multiple endocrineneoplasia 2 (MEN-2), although these are rare conditions, andfor patients with a history of acute pancreat
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	, andfor patients with a history of acute pancreatitis. In summary, the overall safety data for liraglutide, sem- aglutide, albiglutide, dulaglutide, and efpeglenatide from theLEADER, SUSTAIN 6, HARMONY, REWIND, AWARD-7, and AMPLITUDE-O clinical trials are acceptable, and the cardiovascular bene ﬁts are considerable, with additional beneﬁts conferred for kidney outcomes.

No heterogeneity was observed for secondary kidney outcomes across baseline eGFR and baseline ACR groups.

The Work Group judged that the majority of well-informed patients with T2D and CKD who cannot take an SGLT2i because of intolerance or a contrain- dication would choose to receive a GLP-1 RA because of thecardiovascular bene ﬁts associated with this class of medica- tions. Patients at high risk for ASCVD or with residualalbuminuria who need further glycemic management might be particularly inclined to choose a GLP-1 RA. In contrast,patients who experience severe gastrointesti

Resource use and costs. Although some models have found the use of GLP-1 RA to be a cost-effective strategy amongpatients with T2D, 397,398these medications are frequently cost-prohibitive for many patients compared to other oralglucose-lowering agents (e.g., sulfonylureas)
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	oralglucose-lowering agents (e.g., sulfonylureas), which do nothave evidence for cardiovascular and kidney bene ﬁts. In many cases in the US, obtaining preauthorization from insurance companies for GLP-1 RA places an undue burden onhealthcare professionals and patients. Even with insurancecoverage, many patients are still faced with a large copayment. Availability of drugs also varies among countries and re- gions. Thus, treatment decisions must take into account thepatient ’s preference, drug
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	take into account thepatient ’s preference, drug availability in the country, and cost. Ultimately, patients may need to choose between the cost of these medications versus their anticipated bene ﬁts, and some patients may not be able to access them. Considerations for implementation. For patients with T2D and CKD, the Work Group recommends prioritizing, afterlifestyle measures, metformin and an SGLT2i as initialglucose-lowering medications. For patients unable to take ortolerate these medicati
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	patients unable to take ortolerate these medications, or if additional glycemic man-agement is needed, these guidelines then recommend prior- itizing GLP-1 RA over other glucose-lowering agents, given their established cardiovascular and potential kidney bene ﬁts (Figure 23 ). This approach is consistent with the recom- mendations from other professional societies, including theACC, 142ADA,145,147and ESC/EASD.144 Patients with T2D and CKD bene ﬁted from GLP-1 RA therapy in RCTs. In subgroup ana

In subgroup analysis from the conductedtrials of GLP-1 RA therapy in patients with T2D and CKD, the cardiovascular bene ﬁts were sustained, independent of age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Thus, this recommendation holds forall patients. However, long-term follow-up and ongoingcollection of real-world data are needed to validate effec-tiveness and potential harms. This recommendation applies to kidney transplant re- cipients, as there is no evidence to indicate dif

Conversely, there is less available safety data for patients with CKD G5 or on kidney replacement therapy, so caution should be exercised in these groups. 399These medications may exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms inperitoneal dialysis patients or those who are uremic or under-dialyzed, or those who have cachexia or malnutrition. Practice Point 4.2.1: The choice of GLP-1 RA should pri- oritize agents with doc
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ce of GLP-1 RA should pri- oritize agents with documented cardiovascular bene ﬁts. When the decision has been made to add a GLP-1 RA, given that the ELIXA (lixisenatide), 381and EXSCEL (exena- tide)376,378trials did not prove cardiovascular bene ﬁt with these agents, and that albiglutide and efpeglenatide arechapter 4 www.kidney-international.org S86 Kidney International (2022) 102 (Suppl 5S), S1–S127 currently unavailable, the priority is to use one of the other GLP-1 RA, which have proven card

Additionally, cardiovascular bene ﬁt has not been demonstrated for oral semaglutide, as the PIONEER 6 383trial was powered for only non-inferiority, although a largeroutcome cardiovascular trial for oral semaglutide is ongoing(SOUL, NCT03914326). Patients with T2D and CKD are a heterogeneous group of patients, and treatment of hyperglycemia is complex. T
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	ents, and treatment of hyperglycemia is complex. Treat-ment algorithms must be tailored to individuals, taking intoconsideration patient priorities and preferences, treatment availability, and cost, as part of shared decision-making. Practice Point 4.2.2: To minimize gastrointestinal side ef- fects, start with a low dose of GLP-1 RA, and titrate upslowly ( Figure 29 ). Practice Point 4.2.3: GLP-1 RA should not be used in com- bination with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. DPP-4 inhibit
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	idyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 RA should not be used together. Given that GLP-1 RA have been shown to havecardiovascular bene ﬁt, consideration may be given to stop- ping the gliptin medication (DPP-4) in order to facilitatetreatment with a GLP-1 RA instead. Practice Point 4.2.4: The risk of hypoglycemia is generally low with GLP-1 RA when used alone, but risk is increased when GLP-1 RA is used concomitantly with other medi- cations such as sulfonylureas or insul
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	other medi- cations such as sulfonylureas or insulin. The doses of sul-fonylurea and/or insulin may need to be reduced. GLP-1 RA are preferred over classes of glucose-lowering medications with less evidence supporting reduction of car-diovascular or kidney risks (e.g., DPP-4 inhibitors,thiazolidinediones, sulfonylureas, insulin, and acarbose). GLP-1 RA on their own do not cause hypoglycemia, but theymay increase the risk of hypoglycemia caused by sulfonylureasor insulin when used concurrently. T
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	sulfonylureasor insulin when used concurrently. Therefore, it is reasonable to stop or reduce the dose of sulfonylurea or insulin when starting a GLP-1 RA if the combination may lead to an un-acceptable risk of hypoglycemia. Practice Point 4.2.5: GLP-1 RA may be preferentially used in patients with obesity, T2D, and CKD to promoteintentional weight loss. Persons with T2D and CKD often are obese even at advanced stages of CKD. Obesity has numerous adverse health effects, including higher risks o

These risks aremediated by “indirect ”effects such as worsened risk factors (e.g., hyperglycemia, hypertension) as well as by “direct ”effects of obesity (e.g., pro-in ﬂammatory state, fat compression of organs). 400,401As a class, GLP-1 RA have demonstrated weight- loss effects. Both semaglutide and liraglutide have been studiedand approved for weight loss in nondiabetic obesity. 402In addition, tirzepatide has also been studied f
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	02In addition, tirzepatide has also been studied for obesity in pa- tients without diabetes in the A Study of Tirzepatide(LY3298176) in Participants With Obesity or Overweight(SURMONT) trial. In the AWARD-7 trial of patients with T2Dand CKD G3a –G4, dulaglutide treatment (1.5 mg weekly) produced a mean weight loss of nearly 4 kg over 1 year, whileinsulin users gained >1 kg on average. 382Thus, the weight differential between conventional insulin and dulaglutide treatment was about 5 kg after 1 y
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	and dulaglutide treatment was about 5 kg after 1 year. This magnitude of weight loss is clinically meaningful from the perspectives of improvingcardiovascular and CKD risk factors and for kidney and heartprotection.

Diabetes self-management education programs are guided by learning and behavior-change theories, are tailored to a person ’s needs, and take into account ethnic, cultural, literacy, cognitive, andgeographic factors. 403The overall objective of self- management programs is to empower and enable in- dividuals to develop self-management knowledge and skills with the aim of reducing the risk of long-term

Self-management education and support are fundamental aspects of diabetes care. Self-management programs delivered from diagnosis can promote medicationadherence, healthy eating, physical activity, and psychologicalwell-being, and increase self-ef ﬁcacy. The best outcomes are achieved in those programs with a theory-based and struc-tured curriculum and with a contact time of more than 10hours with a patient-centered philo

Quality of evidence. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low because many critical and important outcomes were not reported, and surrogate outcomes exhibited low quality ofevidence. The evidence review included RCTs that focused on educational programs in patients with diabetes and CKD toprevent the progression of CKD, improve diabetic control,and improve quality of life. T

The review identi ﬁed 2 RCTs that compared self-management education programs (specialist dietary advice) with multifactorial care in patients with dia- betes and CKD ( Supplementary Table S24 406–408). Only sur- rogate outcomes were reported, and the quality of theevidence was rated as low due to the very serious risk of bias(lack of blinding of outcome assessors, high numbers lost tofollow-up). Additionally, the evidence review identi ﬁed 1 RCT

This study exhibited low quality of the evidence for the self-ef ﬁcacy because of study limitations such as inadequate randomization sequence gen-eration and lack of blinding of study personnel andparticipants.A systematic review of RCTs published in 2018 on self- management support interventions in people with CK

Diabetes self-management educa- tion programs can vary in terms of intensity, mode of de- livery, reach, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. One recent systematic review of 8 RCTs concluded that the reduction ofclinical risk factors in self-management education programs islikely to be cost-effective in the long-term. 412Another review of 22 studies suggested that self-managemen

Healthcare orga-nizations need to b

Healthcare orga-nizations need to be aware of these limitations and considerdeveloping and evaluating programs that are tailored to theirlocal populations. Several de ﬁnitions have been proposed to deﬁne self-management education programs. The ADA de- ﬁnes diabetes self-management education as the ongoing process of facilitating knowledge, skills, and abilities necessaryfor diabetes self-care, incorporating a person-centeredapproach, and shared decision-making. 309NICE de ﬁnes sel

NICE recommends that self-management education be offered to people with diabetes at diagnosis, with ongoing maintenance sessions. 426 Rationale In the judgment of the Work Group, diabetes self-managementeducation programs should be individualized and tailored tothe changing biomedical and psychosocial needs of the personwith T

This recommendation places a relatively higher value on the potential bene ﬁts of multidisciplinary integrated care to improve outcomes, self-management, and patient –provider communica- tion in patients with diabetes and CKD ( Figure 33429–432).

Given thelarge number of patients and comparatively few healthcareproviders and the silent

This recommendation recognizes potential resource constraints and insu

However, it is also these countries that often have the fewest resources to provideexpensive care for advanced disease, making prevention throughcare reorganization and patient education using a “train the trainer ”approach an important strategy to prevent the onset and progression of complications such as CKD. In high-incomecountries, s
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	plications such as CKD. In high-incomecountries, system and ﬁnancial barriers often make delivery of quality diabetes/kidney care suboptimal, which means policy- makers, planners, and payers need to build capacity, strengthen the system, and reward preventive care to enable the delivery ofevidence-based and value-added care for better outcomes. 430,449 Rationale Patients with diabetes and CKD have an 8-fold higher risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality compared to thosewithout diabetes a

KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	tivate self-care, guide treatment strategies, and reinforce adherence to medications.429,434Although self- care represents a cornerstone of diabetes management, thereis also a need to take cultures, preferences, and values intoconsideration in order to individualize diabetes education andpromote adherence. 403 Care organization, informed patients, and proactive care teams form the pillars of the chronic care model aimed at promoting self-management and shared decision-making (Figure 34 ).436The

Inthese structured care settings, trial participants often hadconsiderably lower event rates than their peers with similar or lower risk pro ﬁles managed in real-

In the judgment of the WorkGroup, most well-informed policymakers would choose toadopt such models of care for this population, providing thatresources were potentially available.

Practice Point 5.2.1: Team-based integrated care, supported by decision-makers, should be delivered by physicians andnonphysician personnel (e.g., trained nurses and dieticians,pharmacists, healthcare assistants, community workers,and peer supporters) preferably with knowledge of CKD (Figure 35 ). Decision-makers allocate or redistribute resources, sup- ported by appropriate policies, to facilitate the formation of amultidi

Greater communication and more closely coordi-nated care among different specialties (e.g., cardiology, endocrinology, nephrology, primary care) and other allied health professionals should be a key pillar of this team-basedintegrated care.

No formal economic evaluations, includingcost-effectiveness analysis, were conducted. Practice points In addition to graded recommendations, KDIGO guidelinesnow include “practice points ”to help clinicians better eval- uate and implement the guidance from the expert WorkGroup. Practice points are consensus statements about as
KDIGO-2022-Clinical-Practice-Guideline-for-Diabetes-Management-in-CKD.pdf	Practice points are consensus statements about aspeciﬁc aspect of care and supplement recommendations for which a larger quality of evidence was identi ﬁed. These were developed when no formal systematic evidence review was undertaken, or if there was insuf ﬁcient evidence to provide a graded recommendation. Practice points represent the expertjudgment of the guideline Work Group, but they may bebased on limited evidence. Practice points are sometimesformatted as a table, a ﬁgure, or an algorit

Hence, guideline committees and professional socie-ties have repeatedly emphasized the importance of stan-dardized clinic BP measurements that aim to minimizesystematic and random errors in estimation. The practice ofevidence-based medicine and the likelihood of achievingoutcome results similar to those shown in randomized con-
Chronic Kidney Disease Diagnosis and Management.pdf	results similar to those shown in randomized con-trolled trials require adherence to these recommendations. TaggedEnd TaggedPStandardization is essential because there are many aspects of BP measurement, including the patient’s physicalcondition, clinic environment, and equipment that can read-ily result in inaccurate and unreliable values. 23,25,26A sys- tematic review of 328 articles found 29 components of theBP measurement procedure that can affect systolic BP(SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) lev

Chronic Kidney Disease Diagnosis and Management.pdf	the use of nonstandardized clinic BP measurements tend to result in overtreatment. In contrast, for some people, routine clinic BP readings are lower than those obtained following a stan-dardized protocol, 29,30resulting in a missed opportunity to detect high BP or the need to intensify antihypertensivetreatment. Further, the variability of nonstandardized BP atthe individual patient level is very large. Hence, there is noalgorithm that can reliably convert BP values measured in anonstandardize
Chronic Kidney Disease Diagnosis and Management.pdf	ably convert BP values measured in anonstandardized fashion to standardized measurement equivalents for patient management. TaggedEnd TaggedPThe lack of standardized BP measurement also makes it difﬁcult to accurately determine the prevalence of under-treatment or overtreatment of BP from a population-healthstandpoint. It has been estimated that approximately 1 in 5US adults could have their hypertension diagnosis or con-trol status misclassiﬁed if BP were measured in a nonstan-dardized manner.

Currently, KDIGO is updating 2 existing guidelines on the Management of BloodPressure in CKD and Glomerular Diseases, respectively. Inaddition, KDIGO has recently published its ﬁrst guideline related to Diabetes Management in CKD. High blood pressure (BP) is closely related to adverse kidney and cardiovascular out

Thus, KDIGOpublished its ﬁrst guideline for the management of BP in CKD in 2012. The guideline was derived from a signi ﬁcant effort by the Work Group to summarize the evidence on thistopic available through 2011. Since 2011, new evidence hasemerged, which has important implications to be consideredfor future guideline updates. To this end, KDIGO convened aControversies Conference to examine this new evidence as itrelates to the man

The KDIGO Controversies Conference on Blood Pressure in CKD assembled a global panel of multidisciplinary clinical and scienti ﬁc experts to identify key issues relevant to the updating of the KDIGO 2012 Blood Pressure guideline. Theobjective of this conference was to assess the current state ofknowledge related to the optimal means for measuring BP ,management of high BP in CKD patients, with and withoutd

A guideline update was recommended and commissioned following this Contro- versies Conference. In keeping with KDIGO ’s policy for transparency and rigorous public review during the guideline developmentprocess, the guideline scope was made available for opencommenting prior to the start of the evidence review. Thefeedback received on the Scope of Work

Thefeedback received on the Scope of Work draft was carefullyconsidered by the Work Group members. The guideline draft was also released for public review by external stakeholders. The Work Group has critically reviewed the feedback fromthe public input and revised the guideline as appropriate fortheﬁnal publication. We thank Alfred K. Cheung, MD and Johannes F.E. Mann, MD for leading this important initiative, and we are especiallygrateful to the Work Group members who provided their t

In addition, this Work Group was ably assisted by colleagues from the independent Evidence Review Team (ERT) led by Jonathan Craig, MBChB,DipCH, FRACP, M Med (Clin Epi), PhD; Martin Howell,PhD; and David Tunnicliffe, PhD, who made this guidelinepossible. KDIGO recently appointed Marcello Tonelli, MD, SM, MSc, FRCPC as its ﬁrst Guideline Methods Chair. He was tasked with improving KDIGO guideline methodology by
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ked with improving KDIGO guideline methodology by reinforcing the linkage between the recommendations and the corresponding evidence, standardizing the guideline format,reducing unnecessary length, and enhancing the utility of theguideline for its users. To meet these goals, Dr. Tonelli suggested KDIGO work with MAGICapp, a web-based publishing platform forevidence-based guidelines. The program uses a prede ﬁned format and allows for both direct linkage of the evidence to the recommendation stat
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	linkage of the evidence to the recommendation statement, and the generation of patient decision aids directly from the evidence syntheses used tosupport the guideline. In addition, he also introduced theconcept of practice points, a new form of guidance in addi-tion to recommendations. For cases in which a systematicreview was not done, or was performed but did not ﬁnd sufﬁcient evidence to warrant a recommendation, a practice point was used to provide guidance to clinicians. Practice points do
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	rovide guidance to clinicians. Practice points do not necessarily follow the same format as recom- mendations —for example, they may be formatted as tables, ﬁgures, or algorithms —and are not graded for strength or evidence quality. With Dr. Tonelli ’s guidance and expertise, and through the use of MAGICapp, and the adoption of practice points,KDIGO has aligned the update of the Blood Pressure in CKDGuideline with the current state of the evidence, creating a highly useful document that is rich
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	e, creating a highly useful document that is rich in guidance while main- taining the high-quality standards and rigor for whichKDIGO is best known. The update to the KDIGO guidelineformat is discussed below in greater detail by Dr. Tonelli(Figure 1 ). In summary, we are con ﬁdent that this guideline will prove useful to clinicians around the world who are treating peoplewith high BP and kidney disease.

MAGICAPP LIAISON Lyubov Lytvyn, BSc, MScwww.kidney-international.org Work Group membership Kidney International (2021) 99, S1–S87 S19 Abstract The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents an update to the 2012 KDIGO guideline on this topic. The scope includes topics covered in the original guideline, suchas optimal blood
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	d in the original guideline, suchas optimal blood pressure targets, lifestyle interventions, and antihypertensive therapies in CKDpatients not receiving dialysis, including special populations such as kidney transplant recipientsand children. In addition, this guideline introduces a chapter dedicated to proper blood pressuremeasurement. The goal of the guideline is to serve as a useful resource for clinicians and patients by providing actionable recommendations with useful infographics based on
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	recommendations with useful infographics based on a rigorous formal systematic review. Another aim is to propose research recommendations for areas in which thereare gaps in knowledge. The guideline targets clinicians treating high blood pressure and CKD,while taking into account policy and resource implications. Development of this guideline updatefollowed an explicit process of evidence review. Treatment approaches and guideline recom-mendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant stud

Since then, completion of theSPRINT trial and the revision of blood pressure (BP) guide-
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ial and the revision of blood pressure (BP) guide-lines by many guideline task forces around the world haveprompted the re-examination of the KDIGO 2012 Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure. Upon invitation by the KDIGO Executive Committee, a Work Group consistingof a subset of the members of the original guideline panel andsome new members was formed in 2018. The CochraneKidney and Transplant group from Australia was selected asthe Evidence Review Team (ERT) for the update, and a newo
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	dence Review Team (ERT) for the update, and a newonline publishing software, MAGICapp, was introduced withthe aim to create a “living ”guideline that is consistently kept up-to-date. A Controversies Conference was held in Edinburgh in September 2017 to help better identify the emerging evidence,ongoing controversies, and unsettled questions in relation toBP management in CKD. The conclusions from this confer-ence helped to frame the Scope of Work for the Guidelineupdate. It was decided that sinc
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	for the Guidelineupdate. It was decided that since the de ﬁnition, management, and nuances of high BP in the maintenance dialysis popula- tion are signi ﬁcantly different from those in the CKD popu- lation not receiving dialysis, the Work Group should con ﬁne its purview to the latter population in keeping with the 2012guideline. The chapters from the original guidelines have been reor- ganized. The section on pharmacologic agents in the originalchapter on “Lifestyle and pharmacologic treatment
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	lchapter on “Lifestyle and pharmacologic treatments for lowering blood pressure in CKD ND patients ”has been signiﬁcantly streamlined and separated. The lifestyle chapter, Chapter 2, now focuses on dietary sodium restriction andphysical activities. The use of renin-angiotensin inhibitors(RASi) is now included in the current Chapter 3 under thebroad topic of BP management in CKD patients, while readersare referred to standard textbooks for descriptions of variousBP-lowering drugs. The original Ch

The original Chapter 3 on BP managementin CKD patients without diabetes and the original Chapter 4 on CKD patients with diabetes are now consolidated into the current Chapter 3, which covers both subgroups, with theliterature on patients with diabetes and without, combined andsynthesized. The current Chapter 3 also includes guidancerelated to older adults with CKD, which was in a separatechapter in the original guideline. Since older adults compriseda substanti
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	guideline. Since older adults compriseda substantial proportion of the cohort in the SPRINT trial, itforms a major basis for the current recommendation of the BP target. Finally, the respective chapters on kidney transplant recipients and children with CKD have both been retained andupdated.The Work Group has identi ﬁed 2 major areas that warrant particular attention in this guideline updatebecause of new evidence and interests that have emergedsince the publication of the original guideline. Th
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ince the publication of the original guideline. These 2 areas are: (i) BP measurement (Chapter 1) and (ii) BP targets within the domain of BP management in CKD patients notreceiving dialysis (Chapter 3). These 2 issues are closelyrelated as the systolic BP (SBP) target of <120 mm Hg recommended in Chapter 3 is contingent upon proper BPmeasurement technique following recommended rigorousprocedures. This lower SBP target is largely based on its car- dioprotective, survival, and potential cognitive
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	- dioprotective, survival, and potential cognitive bene ﬁts. There are no new data supporting the renoprotective bene ﬁts of targeting SBP <120 mm Hg. The overall evidence for kidney protection at this low SBP level is almost non-existent, but itis somewhat more convincing for CKD patients with pro-teinuria and long-term follow-up. There are certain subpopulations in CKD in which the evidence supporting the SBP target of <120 mm Hg is less rigorous; hence, the risk –beneﬁt ratios in those instan
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	us; hence, the risk –beneﬁt ratios in those instances are less certain. These subpopulations include those withdiabetes, advanced CKD (G4 and G5), signi ﬁcant protein- uria, very low diastolic blood pressure (DBP), “white-coat ” hypertension, and at extreme ages (younger or older). Thus,randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in these subpopulationsare necessary. The term “high BP ”is used throughout the document to denote BP above the target. For most patients with CKD not receiving dialysis, the t
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	st patients with CKD not receiving dialysis, the target is SBP <120 mm Hg. For kidney transplant recipients (Chapter 4), the target SBP is <130 mm Hg, and target diastolic BP (DBP) is <80 mm Hg. For children with CKD (Chapter 5), a mean arterial pressure(MAP, calculated as DBP þ1/3/C2pulse pressure) #50th percentile for age, sex, and height is the primary target. The Work Group fully emphasizes that individualization of management, including consideration of the patient ’s characteristics, toler
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ideration of the patient ’s characteristics, tolerability, and preferences is crucial, as it is in other areas of medical management. However, the WorkGroup also feels that some guidance should be provided topractitioners and that these pra ctitioners should be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence underlying therecommendations. Evidence in all chapters has been care-fully gathered and scrutinized by the ERT, including areas in which the Work Group decided that update or revision
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ich the Work Group decided that update or revision of the guideline is unnecessary. This guideline focuses exclu- sively on high BP and does not discuss other health-relatedissues of CKD, such as smoking or obesity. We also do notdiscuss bene ﬁts and harms of physical activity or diet beyond their effects on BP. As in many other KDIGOguidelines, recommendations for further research are an integral component as it will facilitate the update and revision of future guidelines on BP management in CK

For most adult patients with CKD not receiving dialysis, the target is SBP <120 mm Hg (Chapter 3). For adult kidney transplant recipients, the target remains SBP <130 mm Hg/DBP <80 mm Hg (Chapter 4). For pediatric populations, MAP (calculated as DBP þ1/3/C2pulse pressure) targets are age-dependent (Chapter 5). Given that these targets vary according to the subpopulation of interest, we have avoided the term “hypertension ”when referring to treatment decisions, as the term “hy

Chapter 1: Blood pressure measurement Recommendation 1.1: We recommend standardized of ﬁce BP measurement in preference to routine of ﬁce BP measurement for the management of high BP in adults (1B). Practice Point 1.1: An oscillometric BP device may be preferable to a manual BP device for standardized of ﬁce BP measurement; however, standardizati
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ized of ﬁce BP measurement; however, standardization emphasizes adequate preparations for BP measurement, not the type of equipment. Practice Point 1.2: Automated of ﬁce BP (AOBP), either attended or unattended, may be the preferred method of stan- dardized of ﬁce BP measurement. Practice Point 1.3: Oscillometric devices can be used to measure BP among patients with atrial ﬁbrillation. Recommendation 1.2: We suggest that out-of-of ﬁce BP measurements with ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or home
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ents with ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or home BP monitoring (HBPM) be used to complement standardized of ﬁce BP readings for the management of high BP (2B). Chapter 2: Lifestyle interventions for lowering blood pressure in patients with CKD not receiving dialysis 2.1. Sodium intake Recommendation 2.1.1: We suggest targeting a sodium intake <2 g of sodium per day (or <90 mmol of sodium per day, or <5 g of sodium chloride per day) in patients with high BP and CKD (2C). Practice Point 2.1.1: Di

Practice Point 2.1.1: Dietary sodium restriction is usually not appropriate for patients with sodium-wasting nephropathy. Practice Point 2.1.2: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) –type diet or use of salt substitutes that are rich in potassium may not be appropriate for patients with advanced CKD or those with hyporeninemichypoaldosteronism or other causes of impaired potassium excretion because of the potential forhyperkalemia. 2.2. Physical activity Re

Physical activity Recommendation 2.2.1: We suggest that patients with high BP and CKD be advised to undertake moderate- intensity physical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 minutes per week, or to a level compatible with their cardiovascular and physical tolerance (2C). Practice Point 2.2.1: Consider the cardiorespiratory ﬁtness status, physical limitations, cognitive function, and risk of falls when deciding on the implementation and intensity of p

There may still be important health bene ﬁts even if physical activity falls below targets proposed for the general population.
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	below targets proposed for the general population. Chapter 3: Blood pressure management in patients with CKD, with or without diabetes, not receiving dialysis 3.1. Blood pressure targets Recommendation 3.1.1: We suggest that adults with high BP and CKD be treated with a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of <120 mm Hg, when tolerated, using standardized of ﬁce BP measurement ( 2B). Practice Point 3.1.1: It is potentially hazardous to apply the recommended SBP target of <120 mm Hg to BP mea- su
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	recommended SBP target of <120 mm Hg to BP mea- surements obtained in a non-standardized manner. Practice Point 3.1.2: Clinicians can reasonably offer less intensive BP-lowering therapy in patients with very limited life expectancy or symptomatic postural hypotension. 3.2 Treatment with antihypertensive drugs, including RAS inhibitors (RASi) Recommendation 3.2.1: We recommend starting renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (RASi) (angiotensin-con- verting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or angiotensin II r
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	erting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi] or angiotensin II receptor blocker [ARB]) for people with high BP, CKD, and severely increased albuminuria (G1 –G4, A3) without diabetes (1B). Recommendation 3.2.2: We suggest starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with high BP, CKD, and moderately increased albuminuria (G1 –G4, A2) without diabetes (2C). Recommendation 3.2.3: We recommend starting RASi (ACEi or ARB) for people with high BP, CKD, and moderately-to-severely increased albuminuria (G1 –G4, A2 and A3)
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	everely increased albuminuria (G1 –G4, A2 and A3) with diabetes (1B). Practice Point 3.2.1: It may be reasonable to treat people with high BP, CKD, and no albuminuria, with or without diabetes, with RASi (ACEi or ARB). Practice Point 3.2.2: RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that is tolerated to achieve the bene ﬁts described because the proven bene ﬁts were achieved in trials using these doses. Practice Point 3.2.3: Changes in BP, serum creatinine, and ser
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	nt 3.2.3: Changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2-4 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending on the current GFR and serum potassium. Practice Point 3.2.4: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Practice Point 3.2.5: Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks followi
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	nine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Practice Point 3.2.6: Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptomswhile treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate [eGFR] <15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). Practice Point 3.2.7: Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are effective for managemen

Chapter 5: Blood pressure management in children with CKD Recommendation 5.1: We suggest that in children with CKD, 24-hour mean arterial pressure (MAP) by ABPM should be lowered to £50th percentile for age, sex, and height (2C). Practice Point 5.1: We suggest monitoring BP once a year with ABPM, and monitoring every 3 –6 months with stan- dardized auscultatory of ﬁce BP in children with CKD. Prac
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	auscultatory of ﬁce BP in children with CKD. Practice Point 5.2: In children with high BP and CKD, when ABPM is not available, manual auscultatory of ﬁce BP obtained in a protocol-driven standardized setting targeting achieved SBP <90th percentile for age, sex, and height of normal children is a reasonable approach. Practice Point 5.3: Use ACEi or ARB as ﬁrst-line therapy for high BP in children with CKD. These drugs lower proteinuria and are usually well tolerated, but they carry the risk of h

An independent systematic reviewwas not undertaken by the ERT. Throughout this chapter, standardized of ﬁce BP refers to measurements obtained according to recommended prepa-ration procedures ( Figure 2 1,2), regardless of the type of equipment used. In contrast, routine of ﬁce BP refers to measurements obtained without following these recom- mended preparation proced

An oscillometric BP device may be preferable to a manual BP device for standardized of ﬁce BP measurement (see Practice Point 1.1.), but the main emphasis is on theimportance of measuring BP according to recommendedpreparation proc

Manual BP may be measured with either a mercury or aneroid sphygmoma-nometer. However, aneroid devices require frequent calibra-tion: every 6 months for wall-mounted and every 2 –4 weeks for handheld devices. 3,4Oscillometric devices generally require less-frequent calibration (e.g., every 1 –2 years, based on manufacturer recommendations), than aneroid devices.3 1  Have the patient relax, sitting in a chair (feet on floor, b

AOBP can be performed either with the patient alone (i.e., unattended) or with a healthcare provider/technician present (i.e., attended), whereas the otherofﬁce BP methods all require a healthcare provider to be present to perform the measurement. We suggest that AOBPis the preferred method of standardized of ﬁce BP measure- ment (see Practice Point 1.2), but we hav

Recommendation 1.1: We recommend standardized ofﬁce BP measurement in preference to routine of- ﬁce BP measurement for the management of high BP in adults (1B). This recommendation places a relatively higher value on con- sistency with the BP measurement methods used to de ﬁne BP targets in prior large clinical outcome trials. It also places ahigher value on avoidance of misclassi ﬁcation

This recommendationplaces a lower value on the increased burden to patients, pro-viders, and staff. This recommendation is strong because, in the Work Group ’s opinion, the importance of of ﬁce BP measured using a standardized versus a routine, non-standardizedapproach outweighs any potential burden to its implementation.

This recommendation relies heavily on the importance of standardized of ﬁce BP mea- surement protocols that are consistent with large randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs) with clinically important outcomes that have been used to de ﬁne BP targets. Standardized of ﬁce BP measurements allow for extrapolation of the RCT ﬁndings to clinical practice and avoid overtreatment or undertreat-ment of high BP that may occur if non-standardized mea-surements are used. The negative

The negative aspects of standardizedofﬁce BP measurement, including the increased burden on patient, provider, staff time, and clinic space, are outweighedby the bene ﬁts. Quality of evidence. There is moderate-quality evidence that routine of ﬁce BP is generally, but not invariably, higher than standardized of ﬁce BP, regardless of whether manual or oscillometric devices are used. However, there is strongevidence that the relationship between routine of ﬁce

Thus, it is not possible to apply a correction factor totranslate a given routine BP value to standardized of ﬁce BP. Values and preferences. Appropriate BP management re- quires proper BP measurements. All large randomized BPoutcome trials used standardized of ﬁce BP measurements. In the opinion of the Work Group, the importance of measuringBP in a manner that is consistent wit

Increased costs are due to personnel and clinic time utilization. Routine of ﬁce BP measurements are generally higher than standardized of ﬁce BP measurements. 5,6Therefore, the use of routine of ﬁce BP measurements for BP management could lead to overtreatment of BP and possibly result in a higher incidenceof hypotension-related adverse events.

Conversely, for somepersons for whom routine of ﬁce BP is lower than standardized ofﬁce BP , use of routine of ﬁce BP could lead to undertreatment of high BP and result in a higher risk of future cardiovascular (CV)events. Routine and standardized BP measurements have pooragreement, including those in the CKD population. 5,6It is therefore not possible to convert a routine of ﬁce BP into a standardized of ﬁce BP using a correction factor in an individual.

Standardized of ﬁce BP does not necessarily require additional equipment beyond the existingBP measurement devices. However, standardized of ﬁce BP takes longer to perform than routine of ﬁce BP, given the need to follow proper preparatory procedures ( Figure 2 ). There- fore

There- fore, there may be an increased time burden on patients,providers, and staff. This approach also requires staff trainingand retraining to ensure that a standardized BP measurementapproach is followed. Adequate access to a quiet clinic spacethat allows for an adequate rest period prior to BP mea-surement may also be an issue in certain settings. However, in the opinion of the Work Group, this recommendation is likely to be cost-effective as it may ave

Considerations for implementation. The use of standardized ofﬁce BP over routine of ﬁce BP holds true for all patients, regardless of age, sex, race, or CKD severity. Rationale This chapter is an addition since the KDIGO 2012 BP guide-line. This recommendation places a relatively higher value onconsistency with BP measurement methods used in p

This recommendation places a lower value on the increased timerequired to perform standardized BP measurements. This recommendation is consistent with other recent guidelines that also underscore the importance of standard-ized of ﬁce BP measurement (e.g., American Coll

The main emphasis is on the importance of obtaining standardized BP measurements th
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	tance of obtaining standardized BP measurements that are made ac- cording to recommended preparation procedures ( Figure 2 ). RCTs and prospective cohort studies used standardized ofﬁce BP measured with either oscillometric (in newer studies) or manual devices (in older studies; Figure 310–13). Studies that directly compared standardized of ﬁce BP measured using an oscillometric device versus a manual de-vice do not suggest overt differences in readings between these2 types of devices ( Suppleme
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	eadings between these2 types of devices ( Supplementary Table S4 14–16). Moreover, all BP measurement devices are validated and calibratedagainst mercury sphygmomanometers, so they would be ex-pected to give similar BP readings. Therefore, BP levels fromtrials that have used different types of standardized of ﬁce BP measurements should, in general, be comparable. The negative aspects of oscillometric BP devices are the potentially higher cost of the device compared with a manualdevice, the requi

In choosing a device, one thathas been validated for accuracy and precision against a mer- cury sphygmomanometer should be selected. Several national medical or hypertension associations have established a vali-dated device listing that has information on oscillometricdevices that are suitable for use. 17–19Providers working in areas where oscillometric BP devices are n

Regardless of the type of BP device used, proper prepa- ration and BP measurement techniques are paramount (Figure 2 ). Practice Point 1.2: Automated of ﬁce BP (AOBP), either attended or unattended, may be the preferred method ofstandardized of ﬁce BP measurement. In the opinion of the Work Group, AOBP may increase the likelihood of ad

AOBP devices can also automatically take multiple BPmeasurements and provide an average BP measurement.Thus, BP measured with AOBP can be either attended (i.e.,with a healthcare provider in the room) or unattended (i.e.,without a provider in the room). Although a recent meta- analysis suggested that unattended AOBP measurements result in lower av

Of note, the SPRINT protocol did not specify whether AOBP should be performed while attended orunattended.

Practice Point 1.3: Oscillometric devices can be used to measure BP among patients with atrial ﬁbrillation. It is a misperception that oscillometric devices do not measure BP accurately among patients with atrial ﬁbrillation. Prior studies comparing BP measured using oscillometricdevices versus auscultatory techniques suggest that oscillo-metric devices provide a valid sy
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	est that oscillo-metric devices provide a valid systolic BP (SBP) assessment inpatients with atrial ﬁbrillation. 27Although oscillometric de- vices may be less accurate for estimating diastolic BP (DBP) than auscultatory techniques, the population with atrial ﬁbrillation is, on average, older, and the emphasis in older adults has been on SBP.28 Recommendation 1.2: We suggest that out-of-of ﬁce BP measurements with ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or home BP monitoring (HBPM) be used to complement
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	or home BP monitoring (HBPM) be used to complement standardized of ﬁce BP readings for the management of high BP (2B). This recommendation places a relatively higher value on detecting a potential difference in BP status based on of ﬁce versus out-of-of ﬁce BP ( Figure 4 ). In the judgment of the Work Group, the potential bene ﬁts of additional information obtained from out-of-of ﬁce BP measurements outweigh the additional costs and increased patient burden that these measurements impose. We sug
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ient burden that these measurements impose. We suggest using an initial ABPM to supplement standardized of ﬁce BP and HBPM for ongoing management of BP. Although ABPMmay be the better measurement method, HBPM is more prac-tical for routine out-of-of ﬁce assessment. HBPM may be particularly important for the management of BP when a clinicvisit is not practical, for example, in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. For individuals not taking antihyper-tensive medication identi ﬁed as h

For individuals taking antihypertensive medication, 1 week of daily HBPM prior to each of ﬁce visit may be useful to complement standardized of ﬁce BP for clinical management decisions. This is a weak recommendation according to GRADE, since there are no large RCTs comparing the effects of lowerversus higher BP goals on clinical outcomes in adults that usedout-o

Hence, the BP target using out-of-of ﬁce measurements is unknown. Furthermore, it may not be feasible to implement ABPM and HBPM in many settings. Providers working inareas where ABPM is not available may choose to use HBPMinstead of an initial ABPM procedure. Patients who ﬁnd ABPM and HBPM to be uncomfortable and inconvenientmay prefer not to use such devices. Key information Balance of bene ﬁt

This recommendation places a relatively higher value on assessing a patient ’s broader BP proﬁle than relying solely on standardized of ﬁce BP mea- surements. Observational studies indicate that the diagnosisof high BP and BP control status differs for a high proportionof adults when BP is measured in the of ﬁce versus outside the ofﬁce, which can lead to detection of masked hypertension, masked uncontrolled hypertension, “white-coat

Further, obser- vational studies indicate a stronger association of out-of-of ﬁce BP measurements with CV and kidney outcomes than of ﬁce BP measurements in the general population and CKD. 29–31 Masked hypertension and masked uncontrolled hyper- tension are present among 9% –30% of adults without high BP based on of ﬁce measurements and are associated with higher risk for CV disease and

Quality of evidence. There are systematic reviews in the general population showing that high out-of-of ﬁce BP is associated with CV disease risk independent of of ﬁce BP .36 Although there are no systematic reviews in CKD patients, the results from individual studies in CKD are generally consistent with the general population data in that BP differswhen measured outside the of ﬁce vers

The systematic reviews and meta-analyses of general population studies provide moderate- quality evidence because of the inherent limitations of observational studies, but the evidence quality is upgradedfrom low because of th

However, no single outcome trial targeting out-of-of ﬁce BP has been reported so far in CKD populations. Values and preferences. This recommendation places a relatively higher value on providing complementary infor- mation to standardized of ﬁce BP that may affect clinical de- cisions. There is a modest correlation between BP measuredin the of ﬁce and o

However, these BP measurements should not be consideredinterchangeable. Importantly, there have been no large RCTswith clinical outcomes using ABPM or HBPM to de ﬁne BP targets. Therefore, at present, ABPM and HBPM cannot beused alone to guide therapy. The recommendation places a relatively lower value on the potential lack of device avail- ability, costs, and patient burden. In the opinion of the WorkGrou

In the opinion of the WorkGroup, many but not all patients and providers will value theinformation provided by ABPM and HBPM. Prior studieshave found that a majority of patients prefer HBPM to ABPM. HBPM has been reported by patients to result infewer disturbances in their daily activities and to be morecomfortable than ABPM. 37–39The Work Group recognizes that some patients will ﬁnd both ABPM and HBPM to be uncomfortable and/or inconvenient, and such patients maychoose to fo

Resource use and costs. This recommendation stems from studies showing that ABPM is cost-saving and cost-effectivefor the management of high BP in the general population.Although studies were not conducted in CKD, there is noreason to expect that the cost-savings would be any different in the CKD population. 40,41In contrast, the cost- effectiveness of HBPM for management of high BP isunclear. 40,41Persons wit

Consideration for implementation. The use of ABPM or HBPM will depend on the resources available. Staff should be trained to conduct ABPM and to teach patients proper HBPM techniques. This recommendation holds true for all patients,regardless of age, sex, race, or CKD severity. AB

ABPM requires recalibration every 1 –2 years, based on manufacturer recommendations. 3There are no standardized protocols for calibrating HBPM devices; however, when it issuspected that home measurements are inaccurate, providersshould ask their patients to bring their HBPM device to the ofﬁce to compare BP values on these devices with those ob- tained from a calibrated device. 42 Rationale This recommendation places a high value on informing anind

Also, observational studies indicate a stronger associ- ation of out-of-of ﬁce BP measurements with CV and kidney outcomes than of ﬁce BP measurements in the general pop- ulation and CKD.

This recommendation places a relatively high value on data from both the CKD population and the general population demon-strating that reductions in dietary sodium intake induce short-

The Work Group placed lower value on the limited availabledata evaluating the effects of dietary sodium intake on clinicaloutcomes, including kidney failure, mortality, and CV disease endpoints in CKD patients. The recommendation is weak ac- cording to GRADE because of the low-quality evidence sup-porting the bene ﬁts of lo

This represents a changefrom the recommendation (1C) in the 2012 guideline based onthe opinion of the current Work Group members, but it isconsistent with the KDIGO 2020 Guideline for the Management of Patients with Diabetes and CKD.

In most populations worldwide, estimated average sodium intake is much higherthan the proposed target of sodium intake <2g(<90 mmol) per day for the general population. Recent meta-analyses of RCTs in non-CKD populations demonstrate a gradedbeneﬁt in both BP and CV disease risk reduction with reductions in sodium intake. Importantly, even more-modest reductions in sodium intake that did not reachthe<2 g per day target were associated with these beneﬁts. 43Indeed, achieved mean sodi

In CKD populations, this recommendation is driven by short-term studies of moderate-quality evidence evaluating SBP and DBP , but not CV events,as endpoints. It is unknown whether sodium intakes far below2 g per day are safe or not. The Work Group notes that there are instances in which recommendations in the general population may not

For example, rarely, CKD patients may have salt-wasting kidney disease in which case this recom- mendation may not apply. In some instances, salt substitutesare used for the purpose of maintaining food-taste prefer- ences in people practicing dietary sodium restriction. Thesesubstitutes often replace sodium with potassium salts. Clinicaltrials of potassium-containing salt substitutes systematicallyexclude patients wit

Potassium-containing salt substitutes differ from foods rich in potassium, as such foods may have other healthbeneﬁts, thus extrapolating data from potassium intake in the diet may not be informative to potassium-containing saltsubstitutes. Although there is still controversy about the risk – beneﬁt ratio of potassium intake, observational studies of

However, at advanced stages of CKD (G4 and G5), a high potassium intake may be associated with higher risk. 44–46The Work Group suggests caution in using potassium-containingsalt substitutes in CKD populations, especially in those withadvanced CKD, hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, orhyperkalemia from other causes until more d

The Work Group placed lower value on the limited available dataevaluating the effects of dietary sodium reduction onclinical outcomes, including kidney failure, mortality, andCV disease endpoints in CKD patients.

Yet, a higher sodium intake associated with processed foods is likely to necessitate additional antihypertensivemedications, greater pill burden, and associated healthcarecosts. The Work Group also recognizes that, although feasible,following a low-sodium diet is challenging in many Westernfood environments. However, this recommendation maynot only bene ﬁt individual patients, but also may in ﬂuence public health interventions and policymakers to consider

Although this may require buy-in from key stakeholders,policy changes, and investment of public health resources,the Work Group believes that the health bene ﬁts of such changes are also likely to be experienced by a widerpopulation than those with CKD alone. Considerations for implementation. This recommendation places high value on evidence linking short-term changes in sodium intake with redu

Although there is limited evidence from RCTsabout the long-term bene ﬁts or harms of sodium reductionin CKD populations per se , the Work Group agrees, with few exceptions, that there is little evidence or likelihoodthat health bene ﬁts observed in the general population should not apply to CKD patients. On the contrary, there is reason to believ

On the contrary, there is reason to believe that the health bene ﬁts of dietary sodium reduction may be particularly bene ﬁcial in CKD patients. Persons with CKD are commonly hypertensive, andsystematic reviews have suggested that the magnitude of BPreduction for a given degree of reduction in dietary sodiumintake is magni ﬁed in hypertensive individuals, particularly if usual sodium intake is high. 43CKD populations also have high risk of CV disease and may therefore have a greater abso

Finally, ACEi and ARBs arecommonly used in CKD patients, and post hoc analyses of RCTs demonstrate that low-sodium intake may enhance theeffects of these medications on kidney and CV outcomes. 70 The Work Group agrees that decreasing dietary sodium intake is likely to also be appropriate in children wi

Speci ﬁc targets are not available from prior studies for children with CKD, but the WorkGroup believes that adjusting the <2g(<90 mmol) daily target for body weight in children would be reasonable. 71 The Work Group considered the speci ﬁc target of sodium intake of <2g(<90 mmol) daily and found no evidence showing different health bene ﬁts or harms at different sodium intake targets in CKD populations per s

Existing interven- tion studies targeting BP in CKD populations typically targeted <2go r<2.3 g daily in the low-sodium arms, which are similar to targets recommended for the general popula-tion. 43,71,72Therefore, the present guideline was created in the absence of data suggesting superiority or inferiority of othertargets in CKD populations. Further, for concordance acrossguidelines from various organizations that might facilitatepolicy dec

Rationale This recommendation places a relatively higher value on studies in CKD populations demonstrating that short-term dietarysodium reduction interventions lower BP , and consistency withﬁndings of similar interventions in the general population. The recommendation also places a higher value on dietary sodium- reduction strategies as a read

Relatively lowervalue was placed on the challenges in following a low-sodiumdiet in many current food environments. This recommenda-tion is made despite low-to-moderate-quality evidence in CKDpopulations per se , especially for hard clinical endpoints, because in the judgment of the Work Group, relative bene ﬁts of efforts to lower dietary sodium intake will outweigh ri

Although there is a lack of RCT data on use of potassium- containing salt substitutes in CKD populations, Work Groupmembers are concerned about the risk of hyperkalemia thatwww.kidney-international.org chapter 2 Kidney International (2021) 99, S1–S87 S33 these salt substitutes may pose to persons with advanced CKD, as well as observational data suggesting that higherdietary potassium intake may be associ

Practice Point 2.1.1: Dietary sodium restriction is usually not appropriate for patients with sodium-wasting nephropathy.

Observational data also show a dose – response relationship between greater levels of physical activity and lower risk of mortality in CKD patients.84 Overall, the available literature did not allow differentiation between resistive and aerobic physical activity, or betweensupervised and unsupervised physi

Somepatients with musculoskeletal limitations, frailty, high risksof falls, cognitive impairment, or severe cardiorespiratorydisease may not be able to achieve physical activity targets set for the general population, but efforts to increase physical activity levels to modi ﬁed targets, in the Work Group ’s opinion, are likely to translate to health bene ﬁts nonetheless. The sp

The speci ﬁc type, frequency, duration, and intensity of physical activity that maximizes health bene ﬁts in CKD patients are unknown. However, the Work Groupfound no reason to believe that interventions with provenhealth bene ﬁts in the general population would not also provide health bene ﬁts in CKD populations. Rationale There are limited data in CKD populations on the risks and beneﬁts of physical activity interventions. The quality of evi- dence i

Nonetheless, short-term studiessuggest that physical activity interventions lower BP, decreaseweight, and improve the mental aspects of quality of life.

Exer-cise programs have also been shown to improve health out-comes in other chronic disease conditions, including CVdisease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These factors led the Work Group to believe that physical activity is like

There are limited data on the optimal type or intensity of physical activity in CKD populations.

The Work Group also consulted with the KDIGO 2020 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in CKD. In an effort to align guidelines, thetarget set forth by the AHA/ACC guidelines of moderate-intensity physical activity for a cumulative d

This target isapplicable to hypertensive CKD patients if their healthcareproviders consider that the individual patient ’s comorbidities and exercise tolerance allow it. For others, the degree of physical activity should be individualized according to their cognitive, CV, and physical tolerance, and adjusted, as theselimitations change over time.

The importance of standardized BP measurement when applying this guideline cannot beoveremphasized. Routine, non-standardized of ﬁce BP mea- surements often, but not invariably, overestimate BPcompared to measurements under standardized conditions(Chapter 1). Importantly, the extent to which routine mea-surements overestimate or underestimate standardized of ﬁce BP is highly variable between and within patients; therefore, no correction factor can be used to con
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	therefore, no correction factor can be used to convert routine BP to standardized BP measurement by calculation. The use ofroutine measurements to adjust BP-lowering therapy confersa serious risk of overtreatment and sometimes undertreat-ment. It should be emphasized that the most importantaspect of standardized BP measurement is preparation priorto the measurement and not the equipment used (Chapter 1).

It should be noted that the medium-sized trials that exclusively enrolled CKD patients and examined target BP levels, such asthe Modi ﬁcation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) trial, 97the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension(AASK) trial, 98and the Blood-Pressure Control for Renoprotection in Patients with Non-diabetic ChronicRenal Disease (REIN-2) trial, 99had used kidney events as the primary outcomes and had relatively few non-kidney events during the trial.

In contrast, the larger trials that did not exclusively enroll CKD patients, such as the SystolicHypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) trial, 100the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3)trial, 101the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial,92and the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT),93used CV events as the primary outcomes and had relatively few kidney events, although there might be

These dichotomies and the heterogeneityin the characteristics of the study cohorts create challengesin data synthesis to provide an evidence base for practicerecommendations in CKD.

In the general population, there is extensive evidence that the reduction inthe risk of CV events is proportional to the SBP reduction achieved, with the absolute ben

Outcomes in patients with andwithout albuminuria at baseline were not reported separately. SPRINT provides further evidence that intensive SBP lowering reduces CV events and death in those at high CVrisk.

However, the inclusion of large numbers oftrials comparing antihypertensive drugs versus placebo, notlower versus higher BP target, and importantly, those inwhich BP measurement technique was less precisely speci ﬁed makes drawing conclusions challenging. 109 Adults with CKD.

In the primary analysis of the entire cohort of 9361 participants,SPRINT demonstrated bene ﬁts for the primary CV outcome (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.75; 95% con ﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.64 – 0.89) and for all-cause death (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.60 –0.90) across all subgroups with no heterogene

Garrison et al. analyzed RCTs conducted in hypertensive adults aged 65 years or older and reported outcomes for higher SBP (150 –160 mm Hg) or DBP (95–105 mm Hg), compared to a lower treatment target of#140/90 mm Hg. 112SPRINT was excluded from this analysis because its lower target was lower than the inclusioncriteria of the meta-analysis. Its inclusion may have changedthe results

Based on this meta-analysis,there was insuf ﬁcient evidence to determine whether a lower SBP target provides meaningful differences in bene ﬁts or harms to older adults. However, there are very few major trials and relatively few events in this meta-analysis. Incontrast, Bavishi et al. included RCTs in a meta-analysis comparing intensive versus standard or less-intensive BPcontrol in older adults ( $65 years) and provided lo

There were reductions in major CVevents, CV mortality, and heart failure (HF), but a possible increase in AKI and serious adverse events. No analysis of the older population with CKD was described in these studies. There is only one large study analyzing the effects of lower BP targets in CKD patients older than 75 years. A post hoc analysis of that speci ﬁc sub

A post hoc analysis of that speci ﬁc subgroup in SPRINT showed that the low BP target (SBP <120 mm Hg) reduced the primary CV outcome (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.45 –0.92), all-cause death (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.43 –0.96), and the composite of primary CV disease outcome or all-cause death (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.49 – 0.90). 91There was no description of potential harm of achieving lower targets in this subgroup of older adults withCKD, although the risk –beneﬁt ratio in the entire CKDcohort and in
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	risk –beneﬁt ratio in the entire CKDcohort and in the entire subcohort older than 75 years in SPRINT was favorable. Even in the age group 80 years andolder, subgroup analysis in SPRINT showed that intensive BPlowering decreased the risk of CV events (HR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.49–0.90) and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.48 – 0.93). 96 Adults with diabetes and CKD. Among patients with concomitant diabetes and CKD, the bene ﬁts of intensive BP lowering are less certain than those with CKD with

All previous studies in diabetes with and without CKDhave favored more, instead of less, intensive BP reduction(UKPDS-38, 114SHEP,100Syst-Eur,115ABCD,116HOT117). In their meta-analysis, Ettehad et al. reported that the reduction in major CV events remained proportional to the BP reduc-tion achieved among trial participants with diabetes, but thatthe proportional risk reductions were smaller than the re-ductions in those without dia

First, these meta-analyses differ sub-stantially from each other in their respective inclusioncriteria. Brunström et al. and Et

Brunström et al. and Ettehad et al. included RCTs that compared antihypertensives to placebo, and different BPtargets. Ettehad et al. included RCTs of head-to-head com- parisons of antihypertensive agents to examine the effect of 10 mm Hg reduction in SBP on clinical outcomes. Second, none of the trials conducted prior to ACCORD and SPRINTexamined an SBP target as low as <120 mm Hg. Nonetheless, they collectively suggest that SBP lowering decreases the CVevent rate and
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	t that SBP lowering decreases the CVevent rate and perhaps mortality and kidney outcomes. The ACCORD trial that enrolled exclusively patients with diabetes did not show a difference in the prespeci ﬁed primary endpoint of composite CV events between the intensive SBP target ( <120 mm Hg) and standard SBP target ( <140 mm Hg), but it did demonstrate a signi ﬁcant reduction in stroke (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.39 –0.89), a prespeci ﬁed sec- ondary outcome, with intensive SBP lowering. 92However, ACCORD
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	e, with intensive SBP lowering. 92However, ACCORD included few patients with CKD, as patients withserum creatinine >1.5 mg/dl (132 mmol/l) were excluded, and those with CKD were mostly proteinuric with well-preservedeGFR. 119Therefore, there is little direct evidence from ACCORD alone to guide a recommendation for patients with diabetes and CKD. Nonetheless, there was no statisticalinteraction between CKD and intensive BP lowering on thereduction in stroke risk. 119www.kidney-international.org c

Although SPRINT speci ﬁcally excluded patients with diabetes, 42% (n ¼ 3898) of the cohort had prediabetes, de ﬁned as baseline fasting serum glucose >100 mg/dl [5.6 mmol/l]. A post hoc analysis of SPRINT comparing participants with and without prediabetesfound that the CV and survival bene ﬁts of int

A combined post hoc analysis of SPRINT and ACCORD suggested similar CVbeneﬁts of intensive BP-lowering therapy in the presence or absence of diabetes. 121ACCORD was not only a BP trial, but it also employed a rather complex study design. The partici-pants were randomized ﬁrst to

The partici-pants were randomized ﬁrst to intensive versus less-intensive glycemic control, and then either to intensive versus less-intensive BP control or to the addition of feno ﬁbrate versus placebo on a background of a statin. The trial of glycemiccontrol was terminated early because of higher all-causemortality with intensive glycemic control. 92This adverse ef- fect of intensive glycemic control was also demonstrated in the CKD subgroup of ACCORD.119The ACCORD BP trial reported n

However, a more detailed combined analysis ofdata from ACCORD and SPRINT found that the bene ﬁcial effects of intensive SBP control (with both trialstargeting <120 mm Hg) on combined CV endpoints and on all-cause mortality were similar in the standard glycemia arm of ACCORD and in SPRINT. 122,123In contrast, intensive SBP control in

These interactions lessened after discontinua-tion of the glycemic intervention. 122In another post hoc analysis among ACCORD participants in the standard gly-cemia arm who had additional CV risk factors that wouldhave met the SPRINT inclusion criteria, intensive BP control provided CV bene ﬁts similar to those seen in SPRINT. 124 Similarly, a pooled analysis of individual patient data fr

This evidence is indirect, hencediminishing the certainty of the bene ﬁts and strength of recommendation of targeting SBP <120 mm Hg. Low diastolic blood pressure. Numerous observational studies,126,127including those that examine data from RCTs in apost hoc observational manner,128although not all studies, have suggested a J-shaped curve w

However, this association is heavily confounded, as patients with very low DBP inherently have high CV risks.Beddhu e

However, the CV-protective bene ﬁts of intensive SBP lowering were independent of baseline DBP, including thelowest DBP quintile at baseline with a mean DBP of 61 /C6 5m mH g . 129Whether this bene ﬁcial effect of SBP lowering persists at even lower DBP levels (e.g., <45 mm Hg) cannot be determined from these data.

The effects of intensive BP lowering on GFR are often complicated by anexaggerated early acute GFR decline that is also seen withinhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and thesodium –glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) system. This acute eGFR decrease with BP lowering may be mediated, at least in part, by intrarenal hemodynamic changes. This hypothesis is supported by the following observations: (i) Single-nephron G

The difference in the rate of decline of eGFR in SPRINT after the initial 6 months was small (0.47vs. 0.32 ml/min per 1.73 m 2/yr in the intensive and standard arms, respectively). If this slope persisted long-term, it would take 20 years to cause a 3 ml/min per 1.73 m2difference in eGFR between intensive and standard SBP treatment. Takingbot

Progression to kidney failure and effect modi ﬁcation by proteinuria. Prior to SPRINT, the largest RCTs addressing the effects of intensive BP control in CKD were MDRD,97AASK,135 and REIN-2.99The primary outcome of these 3 t
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	,135 and REIN-2.99The primary outcome of these 3 trials was progression of kidney disease. During the trial phase, when thechapter 3 www.kidney-international.org S40 Kidney International (2021) 99, S1–S87 participants were under their respective randomized in- terventions, none of these trials showed bene ﬁts or harms on kidney function by intensive BP lowering in the primaryanalysis of the entire cohort. A caveat of MDRD and AASK is that both trials targeted mean arterial BP (MAP, calculated as

The lower target was a MAP of <92 mm Hg (equivalent, for example, to 125/75 mm Hg, 140/68 mm Hg, 160/58 mm Hg, ormany other combinations of SBPs and DBPs), whereas thehigher target was a MAP of <107 mm Hg (equivalent to 140/90 mm Hg, 125/98 mm Hg, etc.). Further, the MAP targets variedin MDRD, depending on the age of the patients. 136 A meta-analysis in 2011 conducted by the ERT of the KDIGO 20

They concludedthat the evidence was inconclusive. 137Similarly, the current ERT review found no effect modi ﬁcation according to the presence of proteinuria ( Supplementary Table S1297– 99,135,138). The evidence that intensive BP reduction reduce

The evidence that intensive BP reduction reduces the risk of progression to kidney failure is derived mainlyfrom a prede ﬁned subgroup analysis of MDRD (only 54 pa- tients with proteinuria >3 g/d, but large effect size) 97,139and long-term post-treatment follow-up from MDRD138and AASK.135A more recent meta-analysis of 11 RCTs of lower versus higher BP goals found that intensive BP reduction wasassociated with a reduction in kidney failure events (de ﬁned as the composite of doubling of serum

The MDRD and AASK studies were major con-tributors to this evidence base. The REIN-2 study compared a higher DBP target of <90 mm Hg with a lower BP target of <130/80 mm Hg by addi

However, the study was underpow-ered with a total of only 338 participants and had very smalldifferences in achieved SBP and DBP of only 4 mm Hg and 2 mm Hg, respectively,

The effects of intensive SBP lowering with target <120 mm Hg are only available in ACCORD and SPRINT. InACCORD, which had few CKD patients, there was no dif-ference in progression to ESKD between intensive (59 cases/2362 patients) and standard (58 cases/2371 patients) SBPgroups. SPRINT excluded patients with proteinuria >1 g/d, and the baseline median ACR was only 13 mg/g (1.3 mg/ mmol) in the CKD subgroup. ESKD eve

ESKD events were rare in SPRINT, with a total of only 16 cases in 9361 patients. Noreliable conclusions can therefore be reached on the effects ofan SBP target <120 mm Hg on progression to kidney failurein patients with CKD from ACCORD or SPRINT (Supplementary Table S11 91–93). Previous guidelines, including the KDIGO 2012 BP guide- line, recommended more aggressive BP lowering for patients with albuminuria than for those without albuminuria.141These rec

There is no evi- dence supporting an even lower

There is no evi- dence supporting an even lower target (e.g., <110 mm Hg) for patients with severely increased proteinuria. Mortality. The ERT found 5 RCTs examining the effects of intensive versus less-intensive BP control on mortality inpatients with CKD without diabetes ( Supplementary Table S14 91,97–99,135,138,143). Over a mean follow-up of 3.23 years of the 9351 participants in these 5 studies, 84 deathsper 1000 participants were seen in the standard BP control arm, and 66 per 1000 part
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	the standard BP control arm, and 66 per 1000 participants in the intensive BP control arm (18 fewer deaths per 1000; 95% CI: 26 fewer — 8 fewer deaths per 1000 participants). Secondary analyses ofthe MDRD and AASK cohorts using administrativedatabases have also suggested long-term survival bene ﬁts from a lower MAP target. 144,145The mortality rates were low in these studies, and the conclusions can only beinterpreted as hypothesis-generating. When results of studies in patients with CKD withou

In 9 studies with 13,367 participants and a meanof 3 years of follow-up, intensive BP targets, compared withhigher BP targets, resulted in 23 fewer deaths per 1000 patients,but the 95% CI indicated 49 fewer to 33 more deaths per 1000(Supplementary Table S13 91,92,97–99,116,135,138,143,146–148). A recent
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	13 91,92,97–99,116,135,138,143,146–148). A recent individual patient-level meta-analysis of 18 trials comprising 15,294 patients with CKD (de ﬁned as an eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) found that intensive BP lowering resulted in a signi ﬁcantly lower risk of mortality compared to less-intensive BP lowering; this bene ﬁt was consistent across multiple subgroups.111This meta-analysis included RCTs that compared a range of target BPs, but italso included trials comparing antihypertensive agents with p

Evidence of the effects of an SBP target of <120 mm Hg versus<140 mm Hg in patients with CKD without diabetes is available only from SPRINT. 91There were 53 deaths per 1000 participants in the standard BP control arm, and 40 deathsper 1000 participants in the intensive BP control arm,resulting in a statistically signi ﬁcant difference of 13 fewer per 1000 participants (95% CI: 23 fewer —1 fewer deaths per 1000 participants

In SPRINT, standing BP wasmeasured at prespeci ﬁed visits. 149Intensive BP lowering reduced, rather than increased, the risk of orthostatic hypo-tension. Further, orthostatic hypotension was not associatedwith a higher risk of CV disease events, falls, or syncope. 93 However, it is reasonable to consider a change in medica-tions or less-intensive therapy if the patient is symptomatic or BP is excessively low (e.g., SBP <100 mm Hg).

I nt h ee n t i r eA C C O R Dc o h o r ta n d SPRINT cohort (and in the SPRINT CKD subgroup), therewere higher rates of AKI in the intensive SBP arms, althoughmost of these were AKI Stage 1 and showed full recovery. 150The biomarker data described above suggest that at least some of thefall in eGFR seen with intensive BP treatment could be due tointrarenal hemodynamic changes rather than structural dam-age.

In a post hoc analysis of SPRINT, there was a signi ﬁcant interaction between baseline eGFR and SBP lowering, such that patients with a baseline eGFR <45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2had an increased risk of AKI in the intensive BP arm but no reductionin the primary CV outcome. 151Hence, the risk –beneﬁtr a t i of o r kidney outcomes in the intensive SBP arm may not be asfavorable in this subgroup as in the subgroup with higherbaseline eGFR. However, caution should be used in interpretingt

However, caution should be used in interpretingthese non-prespeci ﬁedpost hoc ﬁndings in relatively small subgroups. In 2 other post hoc analyses of SPRINT, therespective risks of AKI were marginally increased with the intensive BP target in people $75 years old (HR: 1.41; 95% CI: 0.98–2.04) and increased in people $80 years old (HR: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.37 –3.26). These data collectively suggest that inten- sive BP lowering increased the risk of AKI in people with moderate CKD and advanced age, bu
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	I in people with moderate CKD and advanced age, but the episodes wererather infrequent, affecting less than 4% of SPRINT participantsand tended to be mild and reversible ( Supplementary Table S11 91–93).96,107 Polypharmacy. Most participants in SPRINTwere taking 1 or 2 BP-lowering therapies before randomization. The bene ﬁts of intensive SBP lowering are unclear among patients who require 4 or more BP-lowering medications to achieve SBP <120 mm Hg. In a post hoc analysis of the SPRINT database,
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	g. In a post hoc analysis of the SPRINT database, the number of additional BP-lowering medications was an independent pre-dictor of poorer survival. 152However, the requirement for multiple medications to achieve SBP <120 mm Hg may re ﬂect the patient ’s underlying characteristics and does not imply that intensive SBP lowering is not bene ﬁcial. Indeed, in another study using the SPRINT database and more advanced statistical tech- niques that account for confounding by indication, the addition o
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ount for confounding by indication, the addition of a new antihypertensive drug class led to signi ﬁcant reductions in SBP and major CV event rates but no difference in seriousadverse events. These incremental effects appeared to beconsistent regardless of the level of baseline drug use. 153Hence, at present, there is no clear evidence that people who requiremultiple medications to achieve an SBP of <120 mm Hg would have an unfavorable risk –beneﬁt ratio. Nonetheless, poly- pharmacy also adds to

Nonetheless, poly- pharmacy also adds to treatment burden and is often associated with reduced adherence, which may be attenuated by the use ofsingle-pill combinations. Quality of evidence. The evidence on the effects of intensive BP lowering, namely the <120 mm Hg SBP target, on critical clinical outcomes such as CV events and all-cause mortality isconsidered to be moderate due to study limitations, while theeffect on kidney failure is weak. For CV events and all-cause mortality, the
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	weak. For CV events and all-cause mortality, the evidence is primarily derived from SPRINT, in which the sample size was large, the effects of intensiveBP lowering on clinical outcomes were strong, and therewas no heterogeneity in the effects between the CKD andnon-CKD subgroups. Results from the subgroup analysis ofACCORD, as well as the joint analysis of the ACCORD andSPRINT data, lend further support, although there wererelatively few participants with CKD in ACCORD (Supplementary Table S11
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	pants with CKD in ACCORD (Supplementary Table S11 91–93). The renoprotective effects of BP lowering in CKD are primarily derived from MDRD and AASK trials. The evidence is consideredto be of low quality due to study limitations and inconsistency. Theeffects were seen in only the proteinuric subgroups, and in thecase of AASK, the effects were seen only during the long-termpost-trial follow-up ( Supplementary Table S12 97–99,135,138and Supplementary Table S1391,92,95,97–99,135,138,143,146–148).

Further, SPRINTshowed a short-term acute decline in eGFR and no long- term bene ﬁcial effect on eGFR with intensive SBP lowering. Therefore, collectively, these studies did not show convincinglythat intensive BP lowering is renoprotective.chapter 3 www.kidney-international.org S42 Kidney International (2021) 99, S1–S87 Values and preferences. The Work Group places high value on decreasing the risks of CV events and all-cause mortalityby intensive S
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	of CV events and all-cause mortalityby intensive SBP lowering, although the renoprotectiveeffects are more tenuous. The reduction in the absolute riskof all-cause mortality in the CKD subgroup in SPRINT was0.6% per year (1.61% and 2.21% in the intensive andstandard SBP group, respectively). If this trend continues linearly, the risk reduction would be substantial over 20 or 30 years. The Work Group also places higher value on increased pill burden, more clinic visits, electrolyte abnormalities,
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	n, more clinic visits, electrolyte abnormalities, hypo-tension, syncope, injurious falls, and AKI that may be causedby targeting an SBP <120 mm Hg. However, intensive SBP lowering in CKD patients did not cause more serious adverseevents, orthostatic hypotension, syncope, or injurious falls than targeting SBP <140 mm Hg in SPRINT. The Work Group places lower values on the higher risks of mild AKI,hyperkalemia, and hypokalemia seen in the intensive SBPlowering in CKD patients because they are larg
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	SBPlowering in CKD patients because they are largely mild,transient, and manageable. We found no informative studiesof how patients with CKD would balance these potentialbeneﬁts with potential harms. The adoption of an SBP target <120 mm Hg is an ideal topic for shared decision-making between individual pa- tients and clinicians. There is likely to be marked variabilityin how individual patients weigh and value the potentialbeneﬁts and harms of intensive BP control. This may vary with age, cult

This may vary with age, culture, number of drugs (both BP-lowering andother drugs), and other factors. Decision aids to supportshared decision-making are available on the online versionof this guideline (see link to MAGICapp at https://kdigo.org/ guidelines/blood-pressure-in-ckd/ ). These aids are based on the evidence syntheses compiled by the ERT that were usedto develop the guideline and can be used online or togenerate printable summaries of the evidence relating toeach

Resource use and costs. The implications for resource uti- lization for standardized of ﬁce BP measurement, as recom- mended in this guideline, are discussed in Chapter 1. Costs ofadditional antihypertensive drugs are relatively small in viewof the bene ﬁts; however, there may be additional costs for monitoring. The Work Group doe
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	dditional costs for monitoring. The Work Group does not consider that resourceimplications would have signi ﬁcant impact on the recom- mendation. Indeed, economic analysis using SPRINT datasuggest that intensive SBP treatment is cost-effective. 154 Nonetheless, it is possible that there will be dif ﬁculties in implementing these recommendations in countries in whichresources are limited; in those settings, it is probably moreimportant to ensure that all eligible patients have at leastreasonable
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	hat all eligible patients have at leastreasonable BP control (e.g., SBP <140 mm Hg) than to focus efforts on achieving intensive BP control in a smaller fractionof the population. Considerations for implementation. Although there is strong evidence that home BP measurements are predictive of long-term adverse clinical outcomes, no adequately powered trial for guiding antihypertensive medication based on home BPtargets has been reported. Nonetheless, HBPM may help toimprove patient motivation and

The use of standardized of ﬁce measurements for BP management may require additional equipment, clinic space,time, training, and/or change in culture, habits, or policies(see Chapter 1). Practi

Practitioners would bene ﬁt from under- standing the guidelines and the underlying data and rationale, and can tailor the target and treatment strategy for individualpatients according to overall health conditions, response andtolerability to SBP lowering, as well as their preferences.Shared decision-making with individual patients is essential.The practitioners should provide general information andindividualized considerations of the pros and cons of

As worded, the recommendation states that clinicians sho
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ded, the recommendation states that clinicians should target an SBP <120 mm Hg. In practice, adoption of this recommendation in a population of patients with CKD will result in a median SBP around 120 mm Hg, meaning that50% of patients will have SBP >120 mm Hg at any one time. A more stringent recommendation would be that all patientsshould achieve an SBP <120 mm Hg. This would require an even lower target or threshold for intervention. However,adoption of this more stringent recommendation woul
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	doption of this more stringent recommendation would gobeyond the available evidence. SPRINT targeted an SBP <120 mm Hg; the mean achieved SBP was 121.4 mm Hg. Rationale This recommendation replaces the target recommendations from Chapters 3 and 4 of the KDIGO 2012 recommenda-tion on BP management in CKD. 141The most important differences are: (i) the adoption of standardized of ﬁce measurement as the preferred technique; (ii) the adoption of a lower SBP target ( <120 mm Hg); and (iii) the adopti
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	wer SBP target ( <120 mm Hg); and (iii) the adoption of the same SBP target irrespective of the presence or absenceof proteinuria, diabetes, or older age. The current guidelinealso speci ﬁes only an SBP target and not a DBP target (see below). The recommendation of standardized of ﬁce measurement is crucial because this technique was used in large RCTswith clinically important outcomes, and values obtained using other techniques cannot be readily translated to values obtained using standardized
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	translated to values obtained using standardized of ﬁce measurement. If BP is not measured using the standardized technique, the SBPtarget goal does not apply. The adoption of a lower SBPwww.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidney International (2021) 99, S1–S87 S43 target for patients with CKD without diabetes is based largely on the CV and survival bene ﬁts in the CKD sub- group in SPRINT, although subgroup analysis and long-term follow-up in the MDRD and AASK studies also sug- gest kidney
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	n the MDRD and AASK studies also sug- gest kidney bene ﬁts at BP levels that may be similar to the lower BP goal in SPRINT. The KDIGO 2012 guideline reversed previous recom- mendations from other organizations that called for more-aggressive BP-lowering therapies among CKD patients withdiabetes, largely because ACCORD-BP failed to demonstratestatistically signi ﬁcant bene ﬁts for the primary CV endpoint in the intensive BP-lowering arm. Since then, SPRINT and further analyses of ACCORD, together
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	n, SPRINT and further analyses of ACCORD, together with combined ana- lyses of these 2 trials, have supported the conclusion thatintensive BP-lowering therapy might well confer similarbeneﬁts among patients with diabetes and CKD as in patients with CKD alone. However, the quality of evidence for BPtarget among CKD patients with concomitant diabetes is low,especially among those with advanced CKD. The recommendation of SBP <120 mm Hg is classi ﬁed as weak (in the dichotomous classi ﬁcation of str

The Work Group debated whether to provide astrong recommendation for an SBP target of at least <140 mm Hg for all patients with CKD, together with separaterecommendations for lower SBP ( <120 mm Hg) targets in speciﬁed subgroups. This more complex alternative was eventually rejected, on the basis that it woul
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	was eventually rejected, on the basis that it would probably persuade clinicians to continue to adopt an SBP targetof<140 mm Hg for all CKD patients, thus denying many patients the potential advantages of tighter control. A strongrecommendation implies that most patients and caregiverswould want the recommended course of action, whereas aweak recommendation states that the majority of peoplewould want the recommended course of action, but some would not. Regardless of the strength of recommendat

Regardless of the strength of recommendations, but especially for weak recommendations, clinicians shouldunderstand the nature and rationale of the recommendationsand engage in shared decision-making with the patients, asdiscussed above. Diastolic blood pressure as a target. The Work Group chose not to provide a target for DBP alongside the targetedSBP<120 mm Hg, although other guidelines often advocate targets for both SBP and DBP. The reasons for this decision are two-fold. First, for
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	reasons for this decision are two-fold. First, for young patients with diastolic hypertension,it is essential to target DBP. Indeed, a number of earlier trials inthe general population (e.g., ALLHAT) had explicit DBP as aninclusion criterion. However, wide pulse pressure, which iscommon in CKD implies that achievement of SBP <120 mm Hg will almost certainly result in DBP <70 mm Hg in the great majority of patients, making the provision of a separate DBP target redundant. 141,155,156Second, liter
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ate DBP target redundant. 141,155,156Second, literature on RCTs targeting DBP with clinical outcomes is scarce,especially in the CKD population. Both MDRD and AASKstudies employed a target MAP of <92 mm Hg, instead of anSBP and a DBP target, in the intensive BP arm, which is often considered equivalent to 125/75 mm Hg, but it is alsoequivalent to 116/80, 135/70, 140/68, 145/65, or otherﬁgures, depending on the pulse pressure. As discussed earlier, these studies suggest that this intensive MAP ta
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	, these studies suggest that this intensive MAP target may provide renoprotective effects in proteinuricpatients. Hence, it seems reasonable to target DBP of youngpatients with CKD and diastolic hypertension to <80 mm Hg, in addition to an SBP target <120 mm Hg. However, the Work Group is hesitant to recommend a DBP targetbecause of the lack of evidence. Comparison with ACC/AHA guideline. The Work Group dis- cussed extensively the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline that offered a target of <130/<80 mm Hg fo
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ideline that offered a target of <130/<80 mm Hg for patients with CKD and analyzed the reasons provided in that guideline for this moreconservative target, although the SBP target of <130 mm Hg is still more aggressive than those proposed by the EuropeanSociety of Cardiology (ESC)/European Society of Hyperten-sion (ESH) (target: 130-139 mm Hg) and by NICE (target:120–139 mm Hg). 2,8,157,158One of the reasons was a concern that clinicians might apply the target to routine of ﬁce BP readings. The
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ply the target to routine of ﬁce BP readings. The KDIGO Work Group shares this concern buttakes the view that patients should not be penalized forsuboptimal clinical practice. One should not rely on routineofﬁce BP to adjust BP-lowering therapy. It should be noted that Hypertension Canada recommends an SBP targetof<120 mm Hg using standardize BP measurement, 159 consistent with the present guideline. The ACC/AHA guideline provides a table of equivalent BP values among standardized of ﬁce, home,
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	valent BP values among standardized of ﬁce, home, daytime ambulatory, night-time ambulatory, and 24-hour ambulatory measure-ments. These equivalents were established using an outcome-based approach that determines the BP threshold with eachmeasurement technique that is associated with similar long-term outcomes in study populations. 160However, differ- ences in BP values obtained using different measurement techniques vary greatly among individual persons and even within a given individual over
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	l persons and even within a given individual over time. Thus, for any given in-dividual patient, the KDIGO Work Group found no evidencethat one can reliably estimate the BP that would be obtainedunder standardized of ﬁce conditions from measurements taken in any other settings. As a result, the Work Groupdecided that the best evidence-based approach is to usestandardized of ﬁce BP for management (see Chapter 1). Practice Point 3.1.1: It is potentially hazardous to apply the recommended SBP targe
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ially hazardous to apply the recommended SBP target of <120 mm Hg to BP mea- surements obtained in a non-standardized manner. Non-standardized BP measurements frequently yield values that are substantially higher, but sometimes lower, thanstandardized measurements, in an unpredictable manner forindividual patients. Basing BP-lowering therapy decisions on non-standardized BP measurements therefore often risks overtreatment and sometimes undertreatment. In these situ-ations, the risk –beneﬁt ratio

The bene ﬁts and harms of initiation, continuation, or discontinuation of RASi in CKD G5 have not been tested in RCTs. The evidencereview included an assessment of subgroups based on theamount of albuminuria (A1 [ACR <30 mg/g or 3 mg/mmol],A2 [30 –300 mg/g or 3 –30 mg/mmol], A3 [ >300 mg/g or 30 mg/mmol], respectively). The outcomes evaluated, whereavailable, include all-cause mortality; CV outcomes, such asMI, strok

There are no well-powered trials examining CV outcomes or survival comparing various antihypertensive classes witheach other or with placebo in people with high BP and CKD,although there was a CKD subgroup analysis in the ALLHATstudy. 161A few such trials examined kidney outcomes. For example,

For example, AASK and IDNT, which enrolled only patients with high BP, were powered for kidney outcomes and compared the antihypertensive drug classes ACEi/ARB, beta-blockers,and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) while treating to targetBP.

There are, however, no RCTs comparing differentdrug combinations in CKD, as there are no RCTs on antihy-pertensive classes other than RASi, beta-blockers, and CCBs. A recent netw

A recent network meta-analysis by Xie et al. , including 119 RCTs (n ¼64,768), examined the bene ﬁts of treating with RASi compared to placebo or active therapy in patients with CKD for kidney and CVoutcomes and included studies with and withoutdiabetes and albuminuria (A1 –A3). The results demonstrated improved precision with narrower con ﬁdence intervals than smaller meta-analyses reported below. 169Both ACEi and ARBs reduced the risk of kidney failure (de

Although bothACEi and ARB reduced major CV events to the same degreecompared to placebo (18% for ACEi and 24% for ARB), ACEi,www.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidney International (2021) 99,

ACEi,but not ARB, reduced the odds of all-cause death compared toactive control. Results of the network analysis were not sub- divided by diabetes or albuminuria status. Therefore, any antihypertensive treatment algorithm in CKD beyond monotherapy depends on expert opinion,pathophysiologic or pharmacodynamic considerations,
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	athophysiologic or pharmacodynamic considerations,extrapolation from ﬁndings in primary hypertension in the absence of CKD, and small studies in CKD with surrogateoutcomes, namely change in BP over the short term or meta-analyses of underpowered studies. In people with high BP and CKD, and mildly or moder- ately increased albuminuria (A1 or A2), there is limited evi-dence on CV or kidney outcomes from RCTs comparingspeciﬁc antihypertensive drugs to placebo or active compar- ators. There are, how

There are, however, data from RCTs speci ﬁcally in those with severely increased albuminuria (A3), statistically pow-ered for kidney outcomes comparing speci ﬁc antihypertensive drugs to placebo or active comparators. Those trials included people with and without high BP, apart from a few studies that excluded people with normal BP. 98,162There are also secondary analyses of subgroups based on level of albumin-uria (A1 –A3) or eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2, com

In RCTs of primary hypertension examining the effect of antihypertensive drugs on CV outcomes that included partici- pants with CKD, CV bene ﬁts have been most consistent with ACEi, ARBs, thiazide-like diuretics, and CCBs. The data are lessconsistent with beta-blockers, which have been inferior to theseabove classes in some but not all t

However, beta-blockers are often indicated for spe-ciﬁc conditions, such as angina pectoris, post-MI, and systolic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). For CVdisease prevention in those with high BP , unless there is a strong indication for 1 speci ﬁc class, it seems reasonable to begin with 1 or more drugs among ACEi or ARB, CCB, and thiazide-likediuretic. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs have the appare

Non-dihydropyridine CCBs have the apparent addi-tional bene ﬁt of reducing proteinuria. 170If a 3-drug combina- tion of RASi, CCB, and diuretic at recommended doses is notadequate to control BP , additional therapy including amineralocorticoid-receptor antagonist (MRA), long-actingalpha antagonist, or beta-blocker can be used, as well as dihy- dralazine, hydralazine, minoxidil, or centrally acting agents. 171 Higher BP due to ﬂuid overload is common in CKD; therefore, diuretics are, in

Outcome data in primary hypertension favor chlortha-lidone and indapamide over hydrochlorothiazide, 2although this has been questioned and there is an ongoing trial.172–174 Thiazide diuretics lose ef ﬁcacy in diuresis and BP lowering as GFR worsens, but several, including chlorthalidone, metola- zone, and indapamide appear to remain effective

Loop diuretics are often effective at lower GFRs (i.e., <30 ml/min per 1.73 m2). When combinedwith a loop diuretic, thiazides are particularly effective in inducing diuresis, but they often lead to hypokalemia and hy-pomagnesemia. 175There are no data on clinical outcomes with loop diuretics in the treatment of high BP with or without CKD. The most common side effects of each antihypertensive drug class for patient

This recommendation is strong according to GRADE, based on 3 moderate-quality RCTs with important bene ﬁts in CKD pa- tients.

In the IDNT study, hyperkalemia necessitating a stopin therapy occurred in only 2% of patients with RASi, versus0.5% of patients in the other arms. Overall, serious adverseevents were actually lower in the RASi group than in thecontrol group. Therefore, in those with diabetes and CKD G3 – G4, A3, there is strong evidence supporting the treatment with RASi because of their renoprotective effects. Data for people wit

Data for people with diabetes and CKD G1 –G3, A2 comes from the Micro-HOPE study, in which people with diabetes, moderately increased albuminuria, and higher CV risks hadimproved CV outcomes when randomized to ACEi therapycompared to placebo. 201Speci ﬁcally, for the composite outcome of MI, stroke, and CV death, there was a relative risk reductionof 28.6% (HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.6 –0.9) based on 1140 patients with diabetes from the Micro-HOPE study, with a mean follo

Kidney bene ﬁt in this group was largely limited to reducing progression from moderately increased albumin- uria to severely increased albuminuria. Only 18 cases in totaldeveloped ESKD –10 on ramipril and 8 on placebo. 163In the Micro-HOPE study, baseline serum creatinine was 1.06 mg/dl(94 mmol/l), and 474 (14%) of 3238 people progressed to a serum creatinine level of $1.4 mg/dl (124 mmol/l) over the 4.5 years (231 on ramipril

The absolute difference was 26 fewer events per 1000 (95% CI

The risk of doubling of serum creatinine was reduced by 30% (RR:0.70; 95% CI: 0.46 –1.05) based on 6759 patients from 8 studies with a mean follow-up of 32 months and an absolute differenceof 12 fewer events per 1000 (95% CI: 22 fewer –2 more), and was not statistically signi ﬁcant. 163,207,213,215,221,222However, in patients with severely increased albuminuria, ACEi reduceddoubling of se

The risk of progression from moderately increasedalbuminuria to severely increased albuminuria decreased by55% (RR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.29 –0.69) based on 2036 patients from 17 studies with a mean follow-up of 34 months and anabsolute difference of 123 fewer events per 1000 patients (

Similarly, there was no bene ﬁt in CV mor- tality, MI, HF, stroke, or CV bene ﬁt in diabetes and CKD. There was a kidney bene ﬁt with a reduction of doubling of serum creatinine of 16% (RR: 0.

There were no differences between ACEi and ARB for the discrete outcomes of all-cause mortality, CV mortality, MI,stroke, HF, and kidney function in people with diabetes andalbuminuric or non-albuminuric CKD subpopulations(Supplementary Table S23 217,236–239). When compared to placebo or standard of care, AC

When compared to placebo or standard of care, ACEi improves CV outcomes, butfor ARB, there is no improvement. Studies comparing ACEi to ARB in patients with CKD and diabetes may have had an insufﬁcient number of patients to ﬁnd a difference. There has been little evidence to support the use of other agents such as MRA, beta-blockers, and CCBs as the initialtherapy in patients with diabetes and albuminuria for CV orkidney protection beyond albuminuria reduction. For MRAcompared to placebo, ther

For MRAcompared to placebo, there were 3 small short-term studiespowered for changes in albuminuria ( Supplementary Table S24 235,240,241). Albuminuria was lowered by MRA; however, in a meta-analysis by the ERT, there was no bene-ﬁcial effect in RCTs on all-cause mortality, MI, and stroke, and very few events to determine the effect on kidney out-comes. However, those trials were not powered for CV orkidney outcomes. Similarly, meta-analysis showed no evi-dence of bene ﬁts on C

However, the studies were not properly powered forkidney or CV outcomes. The importance of diuretic therapy for lowering BP is suggested by the ADVANCE study comparing treatment with acombination of an ACEi plus diuretic (perindopril plus inda-pamide) to usual care without a thiazide-

The relative risk of a major macrovascular orchapter 3 www.kidney-international.org S50 Kidney International (2021) 99, S1–S87 microvascular event was reduced by 9% (HR: 0.91; 95% C

These improvements in clinical outcomes were associ- ated with a fall in BP of SBP 5.3/DBP 2.1 mm Hg in patientswith CKD G1 or G2, and SBP 4.5/DBP 1.8 mm Hg in patientswith CKD G3 –G5. There was no effect modi ﬁcation by the presence of baseline albuminuria. It sh

It should be noted that in theADVANCE study, 49% of the placebo group were alreadytreated with RASi at baseline, which further increased to 73%by the end of the study, while 25% were on diuretics at baseline, which decreased to 21% in the placebo group at the ﬁnal visit. This ﬁnding suggests that the bene ﬁts seen in ADVANCE might have been due to the addition of the diuretic and/orgreater BP lowering in the active treatment group. There is emerging e
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	in the active treatment group. There is emerging evidence that MRA have bene ﬁcial effects on clinical kidney outcomes. The FIDELIO-DKD study, anRCT of 5734 participants, demonstrated that ﬁnerenone, a nonsteroidal MRA, on the background of an ACEi or ARB in patients with diabetes, CKD, and albuminuria reduced the risk of composite primary endpoint of GFR decline, kidney failure,or renal death when added to standard of care. 258Finerenone also reduced the risk of CV events. However, its effect o

However, its effect on SBPlowering was modest (2 –3 mm Hg), and there was a higher risk of hyperkalemia-related events. At the writing of this guideline,ﬁnerenone has not been approved for clinical use. The trial was published after the evidence review cut-off for the guideline but will be assessed in future updates. Quality of evidence. The ERT updated a Cochrane system- atic review on antihypertensive therapies in patients withdiabetes and CKD, A2 and A3. 259The ov

In the ADVANCE study of patients with CKD G1 –G3, A2, the quality of evi

The best evidence for renoprotective effects of RASi therapy independent of BP control in patients with diabetes, CKDG3–G4, and severe

For CV outcomes, the Micro-HOPE study provides the best evidence for patients with moderatelyincreased albuminuria. 163There are no RCTs in those with moderately increased albuminuria (A2) powered for hard kid- ney outcomes. Published meta-analyses for patients with dia-betes, hypertension, and CKD provided mixed results. Onefound a reduct

Onefound a reduction of all-cause mortality, CV mortality, andmajor CV events in 32,827 people with diabetes treated with ACEi, but this was not found in 23,867 patients treated withARBs. 261A meta-analysis comparing RASi to other antihyper- tensive medications, excluding placebo-controlled trials, in people with diabetes, did not ﬁnd CVoutcome improvement.262 There was also no improvement in kidney failure, but the vast majority of included studies enrolled peop

These meta-analysesincluded patients with diabetes and CKD G1 and G2, A1 –A3, and G3 and G4, A1 –A3, respectively. It is likely that including the low-risk and high-risk groups together led to the lack of statis-tical signi ﬁcance for CV outcomes. Although it is tempting to extrapolate the bene ﬁcial CV effects of RASi to all people with diabetes, in the absence of high BP , CVrisks,
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	th diabetes, in the absence of high BP , CVrisks, and lower GFR (G3and G4, A2 and A3), the evidence is weak at best. For treatmentwith RASi, there is, therefore, a gradation of evidence fromstrong in the CKD subpopulation with low eGFR and severelyincreased albuminuria, to weak or absent in the subpopulationwith normal eGFR without albuminuria. Values and preferences. In the opinion of the Work Group, this recommendation for people with diabetes and CKD withseverely increased albuminuria places
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	and CKD withseverely increased albuminuria places higher value on theability of RASi to prevent CV and CKD events, such as doubling of serum creatinine and dialysis. It places less value on the risks of hyperkalemia and AKI. Resource use and costs. The costs of the RASi medications are probably low in most countries. However, adding RASi to patients with diabetes and severely increased albuminuria will require more laboratory testing and visits to healthcare pro-viders, especially in those with

It will also likely lead togreater incidence of hyperkalemia and AKI —hence the asso- ciated costs of monitoring and treating these complications. Considerations for implementation. There is insuf ﬁcient in- formation to differentiate between men and women for thisrecommendation, and there is insuf ﬁcient evidence that there are different outcomes by race. Rationale We issue a strong (1B) recommendation for treatment with ACEi or ARB for
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	recommendation for treatment with ACEi or ARB for patients with diabetes, increased albuminuria, and normal-to-low GFR (G1 –G4; A2 or A3), because their desirable bene ﬁts in kidney and CV protection outweigh the adverse risks associated with therapy. Nonetheless, these sideeffects, such as hyperkalemia and rises in serum creatinine, maylead to higher costs from additional visits and laboratory testing. Practice Point 3.2.1: It may be reasonable to treat people with high BP, CKD, and no albumin
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	to treat people with high BP, CKD, and no albuminuria, with or withoutdiabetes, with RASi (ACEi or ARB). Patients with CKD, high BP , and no albuminuria are at lower risk of CKD progression. In this subpopulation, existing evi-dence does not demonstrate clear clinical bene ﬁts of RASi for CKD progression, and other antihypertensive agents are as appropriate for BP management. However, we feel that some patients would put a large value on the CV protection from RASiand would be willing to tolera
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	protection from RASiand would be willing to tolerate the potential harms, particularlypatients with higher GFR and a relatively low risk of harm.www.kidney-international.org chapter 3 Kidney International (2021) 99, S1–S87 S51 The HOPE study, one of the largest RASi studies, reported CV bene ﬁts with an ACEi versus placebo in people at high CV risk with or without high BP.163In a prespeci ﬁed CKD sub- group (CrCl <65 ml/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula) of 3394 patients with no or mildly incre

KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	63The PEACE sub- study in those with CKD con ﬁrmed this notion.165 Practice Point 3.2.2: RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be administered using the highest approved dose that istolerated to achieve the bene ﬁts described because the proven bene ﬁts were achieved in trials using these doses. The Work Group judged that a large majority of physicians would be comfortable initiating RAS blockade treatment andtitrating it to the maximum dose approved by regulatoryagencies and tolerated by the patient becaus
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	latoryagencies and tolerated by the patient because of its bene ﬁts in kidney protection, their familiarity with this drug, and its good safety pro ﬁle. The bene ﬁts from RASi administered in less than maximally recommended doses are less certain. However, if forwhatever reason (e.g., hyperkalemia) the patient cannot toleratethe maximum dose, a smaller dose may still be reasonable. Itshould be noted that the maximum dose of RASi allowed by theregulatory agency varies by country, and the practiti
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ulatory agency varies by country, and the practitioners areadvised to follow their respective national guidance. Practice Point 3.2.3: Changes in BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium should be checked within 2 –4 weeks of initiation or increase in the dose of a RASi, depending onthe current GFR and serum potassium. ACEi and ARBs are potent antihypertensive agents that counteract the vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin II. Moreover, blocking the action of angiotensin II causes selec-tive
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ing the action of angiotensin II causes selec-tively greater vasodilatation of the efferent arterioles of theglomeruli, resulting in a decline of the intraglomerular ﬁltra- tion pressure, and not unexpectedly, a decrease in the GFR anda rise in the serum creatinine. In addition, RAS blockade in-hibits the action of aldosterone, resulting in a greater pro-pensity for hyperkalemia. In patients at risk for hyperkalemia, measuring serum potassium before and at 1 –2 weeks after initiation of RASi is
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ore and at 1 –2 weeks after initiation of RASi is recommended, based on expert opinion. 44 An increase in serum creatinine level, if it occurs, will typicallyhappen during the ﬁrst 2 weeks of treatment initiation, and it should stabilize within 2 –4 weeks in the setting of normal so- dium and ﬂuid intake. 263Therefore, patients should be monitored for symptomatic hypotension, hyperkalemia, andserum creatinine within 2 –4 weeks after initiating or changing the dose of the drug, with the time inte
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	changing the dose of the drug, with the time interval depending on baseline BP, serum creatinine, and serum potassium. A shortertime interval is indicated if the baseline serum creatinine ishigh, or serum potassium is already high-normal, or there is ahistory of hyperkalemia or an acute rise in serum creatinine with BP lowering or RASi. Practice Point 3.2.4: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose orstopping RASi. In observational cohorts, hyperkalemia is often associated with a subsequent reduction in dose or discontinuation ofRASi. 44,264,265Pseudo-hyperkalemia needs to be ﬁrst ruled out. Then, there are multiple measures that can be taken tomitigate the hyperkalemia. 44Improvement in potassium control could lead to increased use of RASi in patients with an evidence-based indication. Strategies to control chronichyperkalemia include
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	Strategies to control chronichyperkalemia include dietary potassium restriction; discon-tinuation of potassium supplements, certain salt substitutes,and hyperkalemic drugs; adding potassium-wasting diuretics,and oral potassium binders. 44In CKD patients receiving RASi who develop hyperkalemia, the latter can be controlled withnewer oral potassium binders in many patients, with the ef- fect that RASi can be continued at the recommended dose. 266,267Whether the latter therapeutic strategy improve
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	267Whether the latter therapeutic strategy improves CV or kidney outcomes is being examined in RCTs, such asthe ongoing DIAMOND trial (NCT03888066). Side effects ofthe newer potassium binders are reported to be moderate. Practice Point 3.2.5: Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. This practice point reiterates a common expert opinion and may be a reasonable option for many patients trea
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	may be a reasonable option for many patients treated with RASi.However, there is not a single trial that compared meaningfulclinical outcomes in patients who were continuing versus dis-continuing versus reducing the dose of RASi upon a fast increasein serum creatinine by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, etc. Observationaldata relating acute changes in serum creatinine shortly after RASi initiation to subsequent long-term outcomes are equivocal and contradictory. 263,268–270An increase of <30% in serum creat
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ory. 263,268–270An increase of <30% in serum creatinine from the baseline value does not mandate a dosagedecrease or discontinuation of RASi, as long as the serumcreatinine increase is not associated with other complications,such as hyperkalemia and ﬂuid retention. Practice Point 3.2.6: Consider reducing the dose or dis- continuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symp- tomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despitemedical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms whiletreating kidne
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	, or to reduce uremic symptoms whiletreating kidney failure (estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate [eGFR] <15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2). The dose of ACEi or ARBs should be reduced or dis- continued in patients with hyperkalemia after other measureshave failed to achieve a normal serum potassium level. In general, similar efforts should be made to discontinue other concurrent BP medications before attempting to reduce thedose of ACEi or ARBs in patients who experience symp-tomatic hypotension and has a

Which BP medication to discontinue or which ones to retain woulddepend on the relative indication of each medication. When these drugs are used in patients with eGFR <30 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2, close monitoring of serum potassium is required. On the other hand, withholding these drug
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	equired. On the other hand, withholding these drugs solelyon the basis of the level of kidney function will unnecessarilydeprive many patients of the CV bene ﬁts, and perhaps even protection of the residual kidney function, that they otherwisewould have received, particularly when measures could beundertaken to mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia. 179,271 However, in patients with advanced CKD who are experi- encing uremic symptoms or uncontrolled hyperkalemia, it is reasonable to discontinue ACEi
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	hyperkalemia, it is reasonable to discontinue ACEi and ARB temporarily to allowtime for kidney replacement therapy preparation. 272 Practice Point 3.2.7: Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonistsare effective for management of refractory hypertension butmay cause hyperkalemia or a reversible decline in kidneyfunction, particularly among patients with low eGFR. The steroidal MRAs spironolactone and eplerenone have, in small and short-term studies, been found to reduce BP inresistant hypertension (de

KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ularly among patients with eGFR <45 ml/min per 1.73 m2.275Thus, MRAs should not be used in patients with high risk of hyperkalemia (e.g., hypoaldosteronism or type 4 renaltubular acidosis). Results from the AMBER trial showed that inpatients with resistant hypertension and advanced CKD (25to<45 ml/min per 1.73 m 2), concomitant use of the oral po- tassium binder patiromer compared with placebo allowed a larger proportion of patients using spironolactone at 12 weeks.276A recent trial, FIDELIO, ex

The strongest data come from studies of patients with CKD and diabetes with albuminuria, in which therapy withACEi or ARB has shown improvement of kidney outcomes andpotentially CV outcomes, as discussed above in Section 3.2. Some investigators have advocated the use of dual therapy with ACEi, ARB, and/or aliskiren to enhance the antiproteinuric andrenoprotective effects. However, compared to monotherapywith

However, compared to monotherapywith ACEi or ARB, dual RASi therapy appears to cause moreadverse effects, including hyperkalemia and AKI, that mayoutweigh any potential CV or kidney bene ﬁt. Recommendation 3.3.1: We recommend avoiding any combination of ACEi, ARB, and direct renin in-hibitor (DRI) therapy in patients with CKD, with orwithout diabetes (1B). This is a strong recommendation based on evidence from RCTs of sufﬁcient duration to evaluate kidney and CV protection. There i

There is growing evidence that dual RAS blockade with an ACEi, ARB, orDRI does not lead to long term CVor kidney bene ﬁt despite lowering proteinuria in the short term, but it leads to an increased risk ofharm from hyperkalemia and AKI. This recommendation places ahigher value on preventing harm from hyperkalemia and AKI thanon lowering proteinuria. The combination of ACEi or ARB with MRA was bene ﬁcial in 1 large outcome trial; thus, our recom- mendati

Key information Balance of bene ﬁts and harms. In patients with CKD with and without diabetes, a large network meta-analysis compared dual blockade to monotherapy and included 17,750 participants. Two of these studies excluded participants withdiabetes. 169There was no signi ﬁcant difference in all-cause mortality from dual blockade versus monotherapy in 7studies of 16,862 patients with a

The data analysis of the meta-analysis cited above is echoed by the individual large RCTs, including ONTARGET, VA-NEPHRON D, ALTITUDE, and ORIENT.

The overall quality of the evidence for harm was moderate. The network meta-analysis that compared dual RASi with mono RASi exhibited moderate quality of theevidence because of concerns regarding inconsistency for all-cause mortality and CV events and serious imprecision forESKD due to wide CIs that indicated appreciable bene ﬁts and harms ( Supplementary Table S32 ). 169The ERT review (including Cochr

The ERT updated a Cochrane review protocol on the addition ofaliskiren to RASi therapy with mono RASi. 285The quality of the evide

For CV mortality, ESKD, moderately increased albuminuria, and doubling of serum creatinine, the quality of the evidence was downgradedbecause of serious imprecision due to only 1 study reportingthese outcomes, and all-cause mortality was downgraded dueto wide con ﬁdence intervals that indicate appreciable bene ﬁts and harms. Finally, for the serious adverse events, the qualityof

Values and preferences. In the opinion of the Work Group, this recommendation places a higher importance on preventinghyperkalemia and AKI than on the bene ﬁts in reduction of albuminuria. The signi ﬁcance of these bene ﬁcial effects on albuminuria is unclear, in view of th

Although somebeneﬁt has been found for dual therapy in HF, this has not been conﬁrmed so far in patients with CKD with or without diabetes. The Work Group believes that patients and providers wouldwant to avoid hyperkalemia and AKI because of the associated downstream risks as well as the need for more frequentlaboratory tests, of ﬁce and emergency department visits,

Resource use and costs. Resource utilization and costs in- crease, instead of decrease, by instituting dual RASi therapycompared to monotherapy. Considerations for implementation. Given that dual RASi therapy decreases proteinuria, practitioners might be temptedto institute dual therapy to treat very high levels of albuminuriain selected patients, even recognizing the risks of hyperkalemiaa
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ients, even recognizing the risks of hyperkalemiaand AKI. 292There is, unfortunately, no RCT data on safety or kidney ef ﬁcacy of dual therapy in patients with very elevated proteinuria.293There is a report that dedicated clinics for remission of progression of kidney disease are superior tohistorical controls. 294There is insuf ﬁcient information to differentiate between men and women for this recommenda-tion, and there remains insuf ﬁcient evidence that there are different outcomes by race or
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ence that there are different outcomes by race or age. In summary, dual therapyshould be discouraged for patients with CKD with or without diabetes, with or without albuminuria. Rationale The belief that dual therapies of RASi are bene ﬁcial, compared to monotherapies, stemmed only from the improvement in albuminuria with dual therapy. Addition of an MRA to ACEi or ARB. Limited data have shown that the addition of an MRA, such as spironolactone, epler-enone, or ﬁnerenone, to an ACEi or ARB for r

Beyondalbuminuria, no adequately powered study examining GFR and kidney failure outcomes has been completed with spi- ronolactone or eplerenone. 295However, the recent FIDELIO trial showed kidney and cardiovascular protection by ﬁner- enone despite its modest effect on SBP (2 –3 mm Hg lower) and a higher incidence

The evidence review for this chapter included an update of a previous Cochrane review296in addition to a new search of the Cochr

The term “high BP ”is used throughout the document for BP above the target. For kidney transplant recipients, thetarget is SBP <130 mm Hg/DBP <80 mm Hg. Practice Point 4.1: Treat adult kidney transplant recipients with high BP to a target BP of <130 mm Hg systolic and<80 mm Hg diastolic using standardized of ﬁce BP measurement (see Recommendation 1.1). This practice point is identical to the origin

This practice point is identical to the original recom- mendation put forward in the KDIGO 2012 Clinical PracticeGuideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease. 141The target is also consistent with the rec- ommended target of <130/80 mm Hg as de ﬁned in the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for the Care of KidneyTransplant Recipients. 297 There are no completed RCTs in kidney transplant re- cipients that have tested different BP targets on clinicallyimportant outco

There is only 1 RCT on intensi ﬁed BP control in kidney transplant recipients that compared to standard blood pressure (MAP between 50th and 99th percentiles) versusintensi ﬁed BP control (MAP <50th percentile), and it did not report on any clinical outcomes. 298 The Work Group judged that a target of <130 mm Hg systolic, using standardized of ﬁce measurement, remained a reasonable goal for kidn

A highertarget SBP, such as 140 mm Hg, was in the opinion of the Work Group too high given the preponderance of evidence from RCTs demonstrating survival and CV bene ﬁts of tar- geting SBP <130 mm Hg in the general population. 299–301 In contrast, the Work Group judged that a lower SBP goal, such as 120 mm Hg (see Recommendation 3.1.1), maynot be appropriate for kidney transplant recipients withoutfurther data on the ris

This concern for the lower SBP goal of <120 mm Hg partly stems from observations from the SPRINT trial showing that, compared to the standardarm (SBP target <140 mm Hg), patients in the intensive BP arm had modestly higher rates of eGFR decline within the3-year follow-up of the trial, 91,302AKI (albeit mild in in- tensity),150and incident CKD,134which may be of concern to kidney tr

It is conceivable that kidney trans- plant patients with a solitary, denervated kidney could be at an even higher risk for such adverse events with intensive BP lowering, although this has not been substantiated byclinical data. Data from RCTs involving kidney transplantrecipients will be needed to provide a clearer pro ﬁle of the true risks and bene ﬁts of a SPRINT-like goal
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	the true risks and bene ﬁts of a SPRINT-like goal in this population. Similar to the non-transplant CKD population (Recom- mendation 1.2), ABPM or HBPM may be used to comple- ment standardized of ﬁce BP readings for the diagnosis and management of high BP in the kidney transplant population.As with the general population, classi ﬁcation of BP status using out-of-of ﬁce BP is often different from classi ﬁcation using standardized of ﬁce BP in kidney transplant recipients; the complementary use of
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ey transplant recipients; the complementary use of out-of-of ﬁce BP measurements may lead to more appropriate therapeutic decisions. 303,304 Again, it should be noted that there have been no completed RCTs targeting different BP values using either ofﬁce BP readings or out-of-of ﬁce BP readings in the kidney transplant population. Recommendation 4.1: We recommend that a dihy- dropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) or an ARB be used as the ﬁrst-line antihypertensive agent in adult kidney trans

This recommendation places a relatively higher value on pre- venting kidney allograft loss and a relatively lower value on therisk of a possible medication-related side effect. This recom- mendation is strong because in the judgment of the Work Group, the potential prevention of transplant failure outweighs potentialrisks of burden associated with its implementation. The WorkGroup also judged that all or nearly all well-inf

When these medication classeswere examined separately, only the dihydropyridine CCB group caused a 38% reduction in graft loss (RR: 0.62; 95%CI: 0.43 –0.90) over a mean of 25 months compared to placebo ( Figure 7 307–326). This evidence was derived from 8 RCTs involving 926 participants followed for a mean of 25months. 314,316–318,321–323,326In contrast, the reduction in graft loss caused by the non-dihydropyridine CCB groupwas not statistically signi ﬁcant (RR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.61 – 1.34)

With regard to ACEi there was trial evidence showing that these agents were effective atreducing BP and proteinuria in kidney transplant recipients(Supplementary Table S35 ). However, there was no signi ﬁ- cant effect of ACEi on all-cause mortality or graft loss, andtheir use was associated with a signi ﬁcant increase in adverse events in the kidney transplant population,including angioedema, cough, hyperkalemia, and anemia (Supplementary Table S35 ).

The ERT updated a Cochrane sys- tematic review296and evaluated the quality of the evidence based on RCTs only ( Supplementary Tables S33 –S39). The evidence for the use of an ARB or CCB compared toplacebo or no treatment is considered low quality because ofa serious risk of bias (unclear randomization sequencegeneration and allocation concealment) and imprecision around the effect estimates. Overall, there were very few graft failure events, which

It is the opinionof the Work Group that most well-informed transplant pa-tients would have the same values and preferences for the avoidance of graft loss, as was evident from the SONG-Txwork.

Thus, we believe that nearly all well-informed trans- plant patients would accept the tradeoffs of side effects of aCCB or an ARB in exchange for the possible bene ﬁt of pro- longed graft survival. Resource use and other costs. This recommendation as- sumes that an antihypertensive agent will be started for thetreatment of high BP , and the guideline is to facilitate thedecision on the choice of the agent. In most countries,generic CCBs and gener

Inresource-limited settings, these drugs are most likely to beavailable at even lower cost. Given the high ﬁnancial and human cost of graft failure, and the relatively low cost of CCB or ARB, it is likely that the initiation of a CCB or ARB would be cost-effective. 353However, a formal economic analysis evaluating different antihypertensiveagents in the kidney transplantation setting has not beenperformed. 354 Considerati

High BP can be dif ﬁcult to control in kidney transplant recipients, and most patientswill require more than 1 antihypertensive agent. 299–301This recommendation is for the selection of an initial antihy- pertensive agent with the understanding that other medi-cations may be required to achieve BP control. Patientswith evidence of volume overload and high BP should betreated with diuretics before considering an ARB or CCB.
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	d with diuretics before considering an ARB or CCB.Women trying to conceive or who are pregnant should betreated with a CCB, which is generally safe during preg-nancy and lactation, whereas ARB is contraindicated in these conditions. In kidney transplant recipients with pro- teinuria and high BP, ARB should be considered ﬁrst given the known proteinuria-lowering effects of thesemedications. 296In the early posttransplant period, ARBs should be avoided until kidney transplant functionstabilizes, a
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ided until kidney transplant functionstabilizes, as the acute negative effect of an ARB on GFRcan be confused with other causes of graft dysfunction(e.g., rejection). For most other subgroups of transplant patients (e.g., elderly, diabetic), an ARB or CCB should be considered as the ﬁrst-line antihypertensive agent. Most, if not all patient subgroups, would value graftsurvival as a high-priority outcome. The choice of class(i.e., ARB vs. CCB) and speci ﬁc agent should be based on local availabil
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	speci ﬁc agent should be based on local availability and cost. Rationale This recommendation places a higher value on preventingkidney allograft loss and a lower value on the risk ofmedication-related side effects. There are many advantages of using an ARB or CCB for high BP in kidney transplant recipients, including physician familiarity with theseagents, well-known side-effect pro ﬁles, availability, and low costs. This recommendation is strong because, in the judgment of the Work Group, the
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	g because, in the judgment of the Work Group, the potential prevention of transplantwww.kidney-international.org chapter 4 Kidney International (2021) 99, S1–S87 S57 failure far outweighs potential risks and burden associated with its implementation. The Work Group also judged thatmost transplant patients would take a CCB or an ARB giventhe potential bene ﬁt, and only a small proportion would not. Finally, the Work Group judged that the majority, if not all, of clinicians would be comfortable in
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	if not all, of clinicians would be comfortable in starting a CCB or ARB dueto the familiarity with these agents and their well-knownsafety pro ﬁles.Research recommendations Future research should include: /C15Adequately powered RCT to evaluate CV and kidney effects of targeting SBP <120 mm Hg versus <130 mm Hg SBP among patients with kidney transplants. /C15Adequately powered RCT to evaluate CV and kidney effectsof ARB versus dihydropyridine CCB among patients withkidney transplants.chapter 4 w

This recommendation is weak, according to GRADE, because the potential risks for adverse events from BP lowering may varydepending on the underlying

Inparticular, risks of dehydration, hypotension, and possible AKImay be greater in children with underlying urologic disease thatmay be associated with ﬁxed urine output despite intercurrent gastrointestinal (GI) illness and ﬂuid loss or decreased ﬂuid intake. There may also be burden due to limitations in availableresources associated with BP monitoring via 24-hour ABPM. Itplaces a high value on reduction in kidney dise

This recommendation relies heavily on the data from a single trial (the Effect of Strict BloodPressure Control and ACE Inhibition on the Progression ofCKD in Pediatric Patients [ESCAPE] trial) of 385 participants inwhich intensi ﬁed BP control (targeting 24-hour MAP <50th percentile of normal children) was compared to standard BPcontrol (targeting 24-hour MAP 50th –99th percentile of normal children; Supplementary T
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	9th percentile of normal children; Supplementary Table S40 1,142,355). This study showed a probable bene ﬁt in slowing kidney disease progression and no greater risk of adverse events, such ashypotension or acute decrease in GFR. This study in childrenwas not powered for, and did not demonstrate, differences inthe critical outcome of all-cause mortality. In the ESCAPEtrial, targeting the intensi ﬁed BP control required a larger number of antihypertensive agents than the conventional target, whic

Certain subgroups, those with glomerular disorders, GFR <45 ml/ min per 1.73 m 2, and those with PCR >1.5 g/g (150 mg/ mmol) seemed to bene ﬁt the most. Of note, based on this observation, the 2016 European Society of Hypertensionguideline recommends targeting the 75th percentile of MAPof normal children in a CKD patient with no proteinuria, andthe 50th percentile if an individual has proteinuria. 356This is b

Therefore, the risk –beneﬁt ratio associated with this treatment strategy may differ in different subpopulations. There may be a higher risk of adverse events with aggressive BP control in individuals who are prone to becomedehydrated and are at risk of AKI. This is especia

This is especially relevantto children with CKD and congenital anomalies of the kidneyand urinary tract (CAKUT) who may be unable toconcentrate urine and have a salt-losing nephropathy. 357On the other hand, there are potential CV end-organ bene ﬁts, such as less left ventricular hypertrophy.358 The single RCT of BP control and kidney failure outcomes in the pediatric CKD population utilized 24-hour MAP as theBP target. 142Additionally, the AHA Scienti ﬁc State
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	target. 142Additionally, the AHA Scienti ﬁc Statement on pediatric ABPM currently considers ABPM as the gold stan-dard metric for the assessment of BP in children, as strongerassociations have been reported between ABPM and targetorgan damage in children compared with clinic BP values. 359 Targeting BP control by ABPM in children with CKD is also recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).1However, in clinics that do not have the capacity to provide ABPM, performance of standardize
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	pacity to provide ABPM, performance of standardized, protocol-drivenmanual BP measurement using an aneroid sphygmoma-nometer is a reasonable alternative. Such standardizedmanual BP measurement provides prognostic informationsimilar to that provided by ABPM. 360,361Data from the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Study (CKiD) further demonstrate that manual auscultatory clinic BPs taken in a protocol-driven setting are not inferior to ambulatory BP inthe discrimination of BP-related adverse outco
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	P inthe discrimination of BP-related adverse outcomes in childrenwith CKD. 360However, it must be emphasized that, despite their prognostic utility, RCTs targeting standardized manualBP with meaningful clinical outcomes are not available inchildren. Proper technique is essential for BP measurement. BP should be measured in the right arm using standard practices, similar to the method used for adults (see Figure 2 in Chapter 1). The AAP 2017 Clinical Practice guidelines also provideconsiderable d
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	cal Practice guidelines also provideconsiderable detail on correct BP measurement methods. 1 When possible, in the clinic, the use of auscultatory BP ispreferred, as normative BP data in children are obtainedusing this technique, and there are signi ﬁcant differences between values obtained by oscillometric and auscultatory measurements, with oscillometric measures being slightlywww.kidney-international.org chapter 5 Kidney International (2021) 99, S1–S87 S59 higher on average.1,3,362Regardless,
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	9, S1–S87 S59 higher on average.1,3,362Regardless, RCT data targeting either oscillometric or auscultatory BP measurements obtained inthe clinic setting in children are lacking. 363For practical purposes, the initial BP measurement in a clinic setting may be oscillometric using a calibrated machine that has been validated for use in the pediatric population.1,3However, conversion from oscillometric to ascultatory measurement onan individual basis is dif ﬁcult. In individuals at particularly high
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	is dif ﬁcult. In individuals at particularly high risk for elevated BP (e.g., those with glomerular dis-ease), 364readings should then be con ﬁrmed by auscultation. Use of HBPM in children requires further study and has not been endorsed for the diagnosis of hypertension by the AAP Clinical Practice Guideline. When performed, elec- tronic upper-arm cuff monitors, which have been clinicallyvalidated in children, should be used with appropriate cuffsize. Validation status for oscillometric BP dev

Validation status for oscillometric BP devices in thepediatric age group can be checked at stridebp.org .H B P M should be performed for 7 days (not less than 3), withduplicate morning and evening measurements after 5 mi-nutes of sitting at rest and 1 minute between measurements (total of at least 12 readings per week). These preparations have been suggested to be useful in the initial evaluation ofuntreated children with suspected hypertension, and forchildren with treated hypertension
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ension, and forchildren with treated hypertension before each follow-upvisit to the healthcare provider. 365The advantages of HBPM include the ability to obtain multiple BP measure-ments outside the of ﬁce setting, its relative ease of use, and perhaps higher acceptance by patients and families. Similar to standardized of ﬁce BP measurements and in contrast to ABPM, however, no prospective RCTs targeting HBPM toimprove clinical outcomes are available in children. Reliablefactors converting stand

Reliablefactors converting standardized of ﬁce BP to home BP or ABPM are also not available in children. Additionally, clin-ical validation of newer, more automated BP devices inchildren is necessary. Quality of evidence. The quality of the evidence is low for the outcomes of annual GFR loss and ESKD, as the recom- mendation of a target of <50th percentile MAP by ABPM in children was based on a single RCT with study limitations(Supplementary Table S40 142). The quality of the e
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	Supplementary Table S40 142). The quality of the evidence for the mortality outcome was very low because of study limi-tations and very serious imprecision because death is a rareevent in children. Nonetheless, multiple smaller interven-tional trials and observational studies with multiple mean- ingful outcomes for children have consistently shown bene ﬁts of BP lowering. For example, observational data from CKiD,published in abstract form, suggest that MAP targets at <90th percentile are bene ﬁ
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	st that MAP targets at <90th percentile are bene ﬁcial for children with either glomerular or non-glomerular causes of CKD, and lower MAP at <50th percentile may have an additional bene ﬁt. 366Therefore, a range of MAP targets, including the 50th –90th percentile, may also be considered. Values and preferences. The Work Group judged that the prevention of kidney failure and progressive kidney functionloss would be of high value to nearly all well-informed patientsor caregivers. Published patient
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	-informed patientsor caregivers. Published patient-reported outcome data fromthe SONG –Kids study reported that children with kidney disease and caregivers rated kidney function as an importantoutcome, whereas BP control was also rated as an importantoutcome by caregivers. 367In the judgment of the Work Group, most patients would value these clinical bene ﬁts despite the inconvenience and potential risk of harmsassociated with aggressive BP management (e.g., multiplemedications, more-frequent do

Patients for whom medication burden or theburden of ABPM monitoring are particularly importantconcerns may be more inclined not to follow this recommendation. Resource use and costs. In the judgment of the Work Group, the potential bene ﬁts associated with ABPM outweigh the costs and inconvenience associated with its implementa-tion. Patients and families
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	d with its implementa-tion. Patients and families in areas where ABPM is unavailableor less affordable will be less inclined to follow this recom-mendation and may choose to use clinic-based auscultatoryBP monitoring instead. Consideration for implementation. There are no data that suggest differences in bene ﬁcial effects of BP lowering be- tween males and females, or children of different ethnicbackgrounds or races. However, compared to nonproteinurickidney diseases, children with proteinuria
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	einurickidney diseases, children with proteinuria may derive moreclinical bene ﬁts from intensive BP lowering. 142 Implementation of ABPM for monitoring treatment of hypertension is challenging.368Some children have dif ﬁculty wearing the monitors and completing the full 24 hours of measurements. Monitors are not always available whenneeded; they require time from a parent or other adult toreturn the monitor to the clinic and are expensive. With thisin mind, there are certain situations in which
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	thisin mind, there are certain situations in which there is a lowprobability of ﬁnding elevated BP by ABPM. For example, individuals with clinic BP at #25th percentile are unlikely to have elevated ABPM. Individual practitioners may, therefore, consider less-frequent ABPM monitoring if this level of clinic BP is achieved. 360 There are additional challenges on how these guidelines apply to children who are too young to undergo ABPM or tochildren <120 centimeters in height, for whom no normative
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	<120 centimeters in height, for whom no normative ABPM data exist. Additionally, for those on ACEi or ARB, it isimportant for families to understand how to monitor theirchildren to prevent complications, such as dehydration, hy- potension, and AKI. Rationale The Work Group considered the balance between bene ﬁts and harms, evidence quality, values and preferences, as well asresource utilization in making this recommendation. Primaryevidence comes from the ESCAPE trial in which children withbasel

This recommendation is basedon a post hoc analysis from the ESCAPE study. 142Obser- vational data on standardized auscultatory of ﬁce moni- toring in t

The AAP 2017 Pediatric Hyper- tension guideline recommends that children or adolescentswith both CKD and hypertension should be treated to lower24-hour MAP to <50th percentile of the distribution of BP of healthy children, as measured using ABPM. They furtherrecommend that, regardless of apparent control of BP ac-cording to of ﬁce measurements, childre
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	l of BP ac-cording to of ﬁce measurements, children and adolescents with CKD and a history of hypertension should have BP assessed by ABPM at least yearly. Additionally, this guideline recommends that children and adolescents with CKD, hypertension, andproteinuria should be treated with an ACEi or ARB, largelybased on observational data. 1In the ESCAPE trial, children in both arms of the trial were given a ﬁxed-dose ACEi; therefore, the effect of ACEi per se could not be delineated. Key differen
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ACEi per se could not be delineated. Key differences between the current and prior KDIGO recommendations in children with CKD include that the prior KDIGO guideline made a recommendation for the initiation of antihypertensive medication when the of ﬁce SBP or DBP is consistently above the 90th percentile for age, sex,and height, whereas in the current guideline, all children withCKD and MAP consistently above the 50th percentile shouldbe treated. The use of medications is included in this updat
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	. The use of medications is included in this updateonly as a practice point, as direct trial evidence supportingtheir use does not exist, and the prior recommendation was based on limited indirect evidence, primarily data from CKiDthat showed better BP control with use of ACEi or ARB. 371 Compared to standard-of-care therapy, ACEi in children with CKD did not lower BP or protect against GFR decline, although it has been reported to have a bene ﬁcial effect on proteinuria and left ventricular hyp

Practice Point 5.2: In children with high BP and CKD, when ABPM is not available, manual auscultatory of ﬁce BP obtained in a protocol-driven standardized setting target-ing achieved SBP <90th percentile for age, sex, and height of normal children is a
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	for age, sex, and height of normal children is a reasonable approach. Practice Point 5.3: Use ACEi or ARB as ﬁrst-line therapy for high BP in children with CKD. These drugs lower pro-teinuria and are usually well tolerated, but they carry therisk of hyperkalemia and have adverse fetal risks for pregnant women.

The titles and abstracts resulting from the searches were screened by 2 ERT members who independently assessed retrieved abstracts,and if necessary, the full text, to determine which studies satis ﬁed the inclusion criteria. Disagreement about inclusion was resolved by discussion with a third member of the ERT. A tota

Of these, 290 RCTs, 35 reviews, and 14 observational studies were included in the evidence review ( Figure 8 ). Data extraction. Data extraction was performed independently by 2 members of the ERT. Unclear data were clari ﬁed by contacting the author of the study report, and any relevant data obtained in this manner were included. The ERT designed data extraction forms to capture data on study design, study part
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	forms to capture data on study design, study participant characteristics,intervention and comparator characteristics, and critical and important outcomes. Any differences in extraction between mem- bers of the ERT were resolved through discussion. A third reviewerwas included if consensus could not be achieved. Critical appraisal of studies. The majority of reviews undertaken were intervention reviews that included RCTs. For these reviews, the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess indiv
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	ochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess individual study limitations based on the following items 383: /C15Was there adequate sequence generation (selection bias)? /C15Was allocation adequately concealed (selection bias)?/C15Was knowledge of the allocated interventions adequately pre- vented during the study (detection bias)? /C15Participants and personnel (performance bias) /C15Outcome assessors (detection bias) /C15Were incomplete outcome data adequately addressed (attritionbias)? /C15Are

For some topics, for which there were no RCTs in the CKD population, the ERT conducted reviews of existing systematic re- views. AMSTAR 2 was used to critically appraise systematic re-views. 385For systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies, the QUADAS-2 tool wa

Data synthesis. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects model for dichotomous outcomes, and the inverse variance random-effects model for continuous outcomes. The random-effects model was chosen becau
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	utcomes. The random-effects model was chosen because it provides aconservative estimate of effect in the presence of known andunknown heterogeneity. 383 Assessment of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity was assessed by visual inspection of forest plots of standardized mean effect sizes and of risk ratios, and c2tests. A Pvalue of <0.05 was used to denote statistical heterogeneity, and an I2was calculated to measure the proportion of total variation in the estimates of treatment effect that was due to h
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	he estimates of treatment effect that was due to heterogeneity beyond chance.384We used conventions of interpre- tation as de ﬁned by Higgins et al. (2003).387 Assessment of publication bias. We made every attempt to minimize publication bias by including unpublished studies (for example, by searching online trial registries). To assess publication bias, we used funnel plots of the log odds ratio (effect vs. standarderror of the effect size) when a suf ﬁcient number of studies were available (i.
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	a suf ﬁcient number of studies were available (i.e., >10 studies). 383Other reasons for the asymmetry of funnel plots were considered. Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis was undertaken to explore whether there were clinical dif-ferences between the studies that may have systematically in ﬂuenced the differences that were observed in the critical and important outcomes. However, subgroup analyses are hypothesis-formingrather than hypothesis-testing and should

The following subgroups were considered: severity of CKD, primary kidney disease, elderly age/presence ofcomorbidities, presence of proteinuria or albuminuria, diabetes,number of antihypertensives, lifestyle behaviors/health behaviors. The test of subgroup differences used the I 2statistic and a Pvalue of 0.1 (noting that this is a weak test).383 Sensitivity analysis. The following sensitivity analyses were considere

The strength of a recommendation was determined by the balance of bene ﬁts and harms across all critical and important outcomes, the grading of the overall quality of evidence, patient preferences and values, resources,and other considerations ( Table 6 ).

Formal qualitative evidence syn- thesis on patient priorities and preferences was not undertaken. Resources and other considerations. Healthcare and non- healthcare resources, including all inputs in the treatmentmanagement pathway, 389were considered in grading the strength of a recommendation. The following resources were considered: direct healthcare costs, non-healthcare resources (e.g., transportation andsocial services), informal caregiver resources (e.g., time of familyand caregiver
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	giver resources (e.g., time of familyand caregivers), and changes in productivity. Economic evaluations, including cost-effectiveness analysis, were not conducted for any of the guideline topics. However, the ERT conducted searches forsystematic reviews of cost-effectiveness studies in support of selected topics, such as BP measurement techniques. Practice points In addition to graded recommendations, KDIGO guidelines now include “practice points ”to help clinicians better evaluate and implement
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	”to help clinicians better evaluate and implement the guidance from the expert Work Group. Practice pointsare consensus statements about a speci ﬁc aspect of care, and they supplement recommendations for which a larger quantity of evidence was identi ﬁed. These were used when no formal systematic evidence review was undertaken, or there was insuf ﬁcient evidence to provide a graded recommendation. Practice points represent the expert judg- ment of the guideline Work Group, but they also may be
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	of the guideline Work Group, but they also may be based onlimited evidence. Practice points were sometimes formatted as a table, aﬁgure, or an algorithm to make them easier to use in clinical practice. Format for guideline recommendations Each guideline recommendation provides an assessment of the strength of the recommendation (strong, level 1 or weak, level 2) andthe quality of evidence (A, B, C, D). The recommendation state- ments are followed by a short remark, Key information (Balance of be

Each recommendation is linked to relevant SoF tables. An underlying rationale supported each practice point. Limitations of the guideline development process The evidence review prioritized RCTs as the primary source of evi- dence. For a select number of clinical questions in this guideline, the ERT undertook
KDIGO 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease.pdf	al questions in this guideline, the ERT undertook a comprehensive evidence review beyond RCTs.However, these reviews were not exhaustive, as specialty or regional databases were not searched, and manual searching of journals was not performed for these reviews. In the development of theseguidelines, no scoping exercise with patients, searches of the quali- tative literature, or formal qualitative evidence synthesis examining patient experiences and priorities were undertaken. As noted,although r

There is a greater risk of stroke with SBP target <120 mm Hg  vs. <140 mm Hg.In SPRINT (including CKD) and ACCORD (primarily without CKD), stroke risk was lower or similar, but not greater, with target SBP <120 mm Hg versus SBP <140 mm Hg.

It may be more realistic to have two targets, one for which  there is great certainty of bene/f_it and another which is more  aspirational (e.g., SBP <140 for all; SBP < 120 for some).This alternative was discussed in detail by the BP Work Group but was eventually rejected, on the basis that: i) there are actually no data showing a bene/f_it of <140 mm Hg compared to a target of,  say, <160 mm Hg in CKD; ii) all subgroups within CKD may actually bene/f

The relatively weak grading of the recommendation statement implies that the many people would want  the recommended course of action, but some would not. Clinicians should understand the nature and rationale of the recommendations and
KDIGO-BP-Guideline-Point-Counterpoint.pdf	he nature and rationale of the recommendations and engage in shared decision-making with their patients. KDIGO recommends attended or unattended measurements  but SPRINT and ACCORD used unattended BP .Both trials used standardized oﬃce measurements, attended and unattended, with an automated device. The SPRINT protocol did not specify whether to obtain attended or unattended  measurements, and similar CV risk reductions were observed irrespective of attended or unattended measurement. Diﬀerences

Diﬀerences between attended and unattended BP values are notably small,  so proper patient preparation and measurement is key. The SBP target recommendation is based on a single trial.

The results are robust and there was no eﬀect modi/f_ication by baseline CKD status for these outcomes. In the standard glycemic subgroup of the ACCORD trial  (which enrolled patients with diabetes), the primary CV bene/f_it of intensive SBP lowering was similar to that observed in SPRINT.

In some countries, patients with CKD G3 are followed  mainly by primary care physicians and these clinicians may  not follow the recommendations from KDIGOThe guideline aimed to provide the best possible guidance for the treatment of patients with high BP and CKD.

Since then, completion of the Systolic Blood PressureIntervention Trial (SPRINT) sponsored by the National In-stitutes of Health along with several related meta-analyses andthe revision of BP guidelines by many guideline task forces around the world prompted the re-examination of the KDIGO guideline on BP. A Work Group (WG) was formedin 2018 and supported by the Evidence Review Team fromthe Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Group. Further, new on-l

Further, new on-line publishing software, MAGICapp, was introduced with theaim to create a “living guideline ”that can be updated conveniently. As for many previous guidelines sponsored by KDIGO, a Controversies Conference was held to help better identify the emerging evidence, ongoing controversies, and unsettledquestions. The conclusions from that conference helpedframe the Scope of Work for this guideline update. It wasdecided that, since the de ﬁnition, manag

It wasdecided that, since the de ﬁnition, management, and nuances of high BP in the maintenance dialysis population aresigniﬁcantly different from those in the CKD population not receiving dialysis, the WG should con ﬁne its purview to the latter population, in keeping with the 2012 guideline. Relevant Cochrane systematic reviews were updated with literature searches conducted through September 2019 andupdated in April 2020. The primary data and meta-analysesused to generate this guideline ar

Evidence from the sys- tematic reviews was summarized into tables using the stan- dard Cochrane and the GRADE methods ( Appendix Tables 1/C03). Although no economic analyses were conducted to inform the guideline, resource use and costs were implicitlyconsidered in the formulation of recommendations. To supplement graded recommendations

To supplement graded recommendations, the KDIGO guideline includes “practice points ”that are consensus statements representing the WG ’s expert judgment on a speciﬁc aspect of care. This format was used when no formal systematic evidence review was undertaken or there was insufﬁcient evidence to provide a graded recommendation; yet, these practice points may at times be supported by thebest available evidence. An explicit public review process wasundertaken to obtain feedback from
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	view process wasundertaken to obtain feedback from external stakeholders,and comments and suggestions from the external review areincorporated as appropriate. The WG identi ﬁed 2 major areas that warrant particular attention in this guideline update because of new evidence and interests emerged since the publication of the originalguideline. These 2 areas are (i) BP measurement (Chapter 1)and (ii) BP targets in CKD patients (Chapter 3). These 2issues are closely related as the systolic BP (SBP)
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	sues are closely related as the systolic BP (SBP) target of<120 mm Hg recommended in Chapter 3 is contingent upon proper adherence to standardized preparation andmeasurement protocols by patients and clinicians. The term “high BP ”is used to denote BP above the target for the respective subpopulations (adult patients with CKD,pediatric patients with CKD, and kidney transplant re-cipients). This target varies depending on the particularsubpopulation. After deliberation, the guideline WG decidedno
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	on. After deliberation, the guideline WG decidednot to rede ﬁne“hypertension. ”The major rationale for this decision is that the term may have epidemiologic, psychoso-cial, ﬁnancial, and other implications, and it does not necessarily facilitate the management of BP in the CKD population. Many insightful comments from the public review helped shape the ﬁnal recommendations. The main issues pertain to the perceived impracticality of performing standardized of ﬁce BP measurements, and achieving th
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	ndardized of ﬁce BP measurements, and achieving the new SBP target of <120 mm Hg. These 2 topics are tightly connected but areaddressed in Chapter 1 and Chapter 3, respectively. Chapter 1: Blood pressure measurement This chapter is a new addition to the original KDIGO BPguideline and includes recommendations on how to measureBP in adults with CKD. The rationale for adding this chapteris the increasing recognition of the high variability of BPvalues in the routine of ﬁce setting and the availabil
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	es in the routine of ﬁce setting and the availability of re- sults of large randomized trials consistently utilizing stan- dardized, not routine, BP measurements. The key recommendation is the employment of standardized of ﬁce BP measurement for the management of high BP in adults(Figure 1 ). Standardized of ﬁce BP refers to measurements obtained using recommended preparations and measurement tech-niques, regardless of the type of equipment used. Thesestandardized procedures are presented in Fig
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	Thesestandardized procedures are presented in Figure 2 1, which is adapted from the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) BP guidelines.In contrast, routine of ﬁce BP refers to measurements ob- tained without using these preparations and is often calledcasual of ﬁce BP. Standardized BP measurement is crucial and is an integral part of the foundation for the BP targetdescribed in Chapter 3. The BP target cannot be applied ifroutine BP values are obtained, bec
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	t be applied ifroutine BP values are obtained, because large randomized trials that examined target BP, such as SPRINT, employed standardized BP . Further, there is strong evidence that therelationship between routine of ﬁce BP and standardized ofﬁce BP is highly variable, for individuals with and without CKD. Thus, it is not possible to apply a correctionfactor to translate a given routine BP value to a stan-dardized BP value. It is recognized that standardized BP measurements in- crease the bu
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	hat standardized BP measurements in- crease the burden to patients, health care providers, and health care facilities. However, this recommendation is ratedas strong because the WG considers it to be essential and itoutweighs any potential burden to its implementation. TheKDIGO executive conclusions AK Cheung et al.: Summary of KDIGO guideline on BP management in CKD 560 Kidney International (2021) 99,559–569 recommendation should be widely adopted in clinical practice since accurate measurement
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	ed in clinical practice since accurate measurements will ensure that properguidance is being applied to the management of BP , as it is tothe management of other risk factors. The WG further provides practice points that favor the use of an automated oscillometric BP device over a manual device forstandardized of ﬁce BP measurement. However, the emphasis of standardization is on the appropriate preparations and themeasurement technique, and not on the type of equipment. Out-of-of ﬁce BP measurem
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	n the type of equipment. Out-of-of ﬁce BP measurement is a timely topic and includes home BP and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring(ABPM). Observational studies show a stronger associa- tion of out-of-of ﬁce BP measurements than of ﬁce BP measurements with cardiovascular and kidney outcomes inboth the general population and CKD population. HomeBP monitoring is more readily available than 24-hourABPM and may be particularly important for BP man- agement when a clinic visit is impractical, for examp
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	ment when a clinic visit is impractical, for example,during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)pandemic. Out-of-of ﬁce BP measurements are therefore recommended as a complement to standardized of ﬁce BP readings for the management of high BP . This is a weakrecommendation as there are no completed large ran-domized outcome trials that target out-of-of ﬁce BP values in adults. Hence, one important future research recom-mendation focuses on randomized outcomes trials tar-geting out-of-of ﬁce B

Available data from both the gen- eral population and the CKD population demonstrate thatreductions in dietary salt intake induce short-term reductions in BP and suggest that this bene ﬁt reduces the need for antihypertensive medications. Therefore, consistent withguidelines for the general population, the WG suggests thatCKD patients with high BP consume <2 g (or <90 mmol) per day of sodium ( Figure 1 ). The recommendation is rated 2
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	sodium ( Figure 1 ). The recommendation is rated 2C, because direct evidence in the CKD population is weak.There is also moderate strength of evidence that lowering ofdietary salt intake reduces cardiovascular disease in the gen- eral population. The systematic review conducted for this guideline, however, found no randomized trial data evalu-ating the effects of dietary salt reduction on cardiovasculardisease, kidney failure, or mortality in the CKD population.Even in trials, few participants a

Recent meta- analyses of randomized trials in non-CKD populations,however, demonstrate a graded bene ﬁt in both BP and car- diovascular disease risk reduction with reductions in sodium intake. Therefore, sodium reductions that involve levels less stringent than <2 g per day may still be bene ﬁcial. There are cautions associated with this recommendation. One relates to patients

One relates to patients with CKD and salt-wasting nephrop-athy, for whom reduction in salt intake may be inappropriate.The second caution relates to the Dietary Approaches to StopHypertension (DASH) diet, and salt substitutes that are oftenused in reduced-salt diets. DASH diets employed to lower BP are rich in potassium, and salt substitutes usually contain potassium as the primary cation.

In view of these ﬁndings, the WG suggests that patients with high BP and CKD undertake moderate-intensityphysical activity for a cumulative duration of at least 150 mi-nutes per week, or to a level compatible with their cardiovas-cular and physical tolerance ( Figure 1 ). This recommendation also aligns with the recent KDIGO 2020 Guideline for Diabetes Management in CKD ( h
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	2020 Guideline for Diabetes Management in CKD ( https://kdigo.org/guidelines/diabetes- ckd/). The WG recognizes a higher prevalence of comorbidity and frailty in the CKD population that might limit the level ofphysical activity by CKD patients and increase the risk ofadverse events. Because of this uncertainty and the limitedevidence speci ﬁcally in the CKD population, this recom- mendation is rated 2C. As a practice point, the degree of physical activity should be individualized according to t
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	l activity should be individualized according to thepatient ’s cognitive and physical conditions, which may change over time. Further, health bene ﬁts may be realized even if physical activity falls below the proposed targets. Other lifestyle interventions. Several other lifestyle in- terventions, including weight loss and reduction of alcoholconsumption, have been demonstrated in randomized trials to lower BP in the general population. However, insuf ﬁcient data on the risks or bene ﬁts of thes
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	insuf ﬁcient data on the risks or bene ﬁts of these interventions on BP speci ﬁcally in CKD populations preclude speci ﬁc recommendations. Chapter 3: Blood pressure management in patients with CKD, with or without diabetes, not receiving dialysis Target blood pressure. We suggest that adults with high BP and CKD be treated to a target systolic blood pressure (SBP) of <120 mm Hg, as determined by standardized of ﬁce measurement, if tolerated ( Figure 1 ). This recommendation does not apply to pat
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	ure 1 ). This recommendation does not apply to patients with a kidney transplant or to thosereceiving dialysis. This SBP target is lower than the BPof<130/80 mm Hg recommended in the KDIGO 2012 BP guideline and is based largely on its cardioprotective, survival,and potential cognitive bene ﬁts as shown in the SPRINT trial. The overall evidence suggests that there is no renoprotective effect at this SBP level. The recommendation is weak byGRADE standards (2B) because it is based on a single, albe
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	andards (2B) because it is based on a single, albeithigh-quality, randomized trial with a prede ﬁned CKDsubgroup showing cardiovascular and survival bene ﬁts in the study cohort randomized to a SBP goal of <120 mm Hg versus <140 mm Hg. 2Importantly, this recommendation assumes that standardized of ﬁce BP measurement is taken as described in Chapter 1. Despite the recommended SBP target, the WG emphasizes that individualization, including consid-eration of the patient ’s characteristics, tolerabi
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	ration of the patient ’s characteristics, tolerability, and pref- erences, is crucial in BP management, as in other areas ofmedical management. A meta-analysis from the Blood Pressure Lowering Treat- ment Trialists ’Collaboration, including trials of antihyper- tensive drugs versus placebo and trials of different BP targets, found that the proportional reduction in cardiovascular events with more intensive BP treatment was independent ofCKD. 3The meta-analysis of Ettehad et al. also reported a r
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	meta-analysis of Ettehad et al. also reported a risk reduction for cardiovascular events with intensive BP-lowering in those with CKD, although the size of the riskreduction was less than that in those without CKD. 4The totality of the evidence supports a SBP target of <120 mm Hg over<140 mm Hg in recent large outcome trials that included a prespeci ﬁed CKD subgroup, because of the car- diovascular and survival, but not renoprotective, bene ﬁts of the lower target. In most CKD patients with hig
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	of the lower target. In most CKD patients with high BP, including the frail and elderly, the cardiovascular bene ﬁts of a target SBP <120 mm Hg versus <140 mm Hg appear to outweigh the risks of harm, such as acute kidney injury and electrolyte abnor-malities, 5,6and the risk of cognitive impairment may actually be lower with a target SBP <120 mm Hg.6However, the evidence supporting the SBP target of <120 mm Hg is less certain in some subpopulations, including those with dia-betes, advanced CKD (
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	ns, including those with dia-betes, advanced CKD (G4 and G5), signi ﬁcant proteinuria (>1 g/d), baseline SBP 120 –129 mm Hg, the young (age <50 years) or very old (age >90 years), and those with “white- coat”or severe hypertension. As such, randomized trials targeting these subpopulations are necessary. People with underlying coronary artery disease and a low baseline dia- stolic blood pressure (DBP) may in theory have an increasedrisk of myocardial infarction with intensive BP-lowering,since co
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	ial infarction with intensive BP-lowering,since coronary perfusion depends on DBP. In SPRINT,however, patients in the lowest DBP quintile at baseline hadsimilar cardiovascular and survival bene ﬁts from intensive SBP reduction as those with higher baseline DBP. Finally, we address target BP in diabetes with CKD. Although SPRINT explicitly excluded patients with diabetes, one subgroup with impaired glucose metabolism (fastingserum glucose $100 mg/dl [5.55 mmol/l]), however, exhibited cardiovascul
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	dl [5.55 mmol/l]), however, exhibited cardiovascular bene ﬁts similar to those for patients with normal fasting glucose metabolism. 7On the other hand, Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes(ACCORD) studied exclusively people with diabetes andrandomized them to the same SBP targets as in SPRINT (<120 mm Hg vs. <140 mm Hg), but excluded those with a serum creatinine level >1.5 mg/dl (133 mmol/l). ACCORD demonstrated no overall cardiovascular bene ﬁt, although there was a substantial re

The analyses of ACCORD suggest a cardiovascular beneﬁt of the lower BP target in those randomized to stan- dard glucose control but no bene ﬁt in those randomized to intensive glucose control, though the data remain hypothesis- generating.8Based on these and other
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	hypothesis- generating.8Based on these and other data, the WG feels that cardiovascular bene ﬁts of intensive BP-lowering cannot be excluded in patients with concomitant diabetes and CKD andthat a large randomized trial addressing this issue iswarranted. Uncertainty about bene ﬁts and risks of intense BP- lowering in the various scenarios above does not necessarilyimply that intensive SBP-lowering is not warranted, but does suggest that the uncertainty and the potential adverse effects should b
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	rtainty and the potential adverse effects should be taken into consideration when deciding on the BPtarget for individual patients. If the patient cannot tolerateSBP<120 mm Hg despite a slow, gradual decrease in SBP over months, an individualized approach should be followed,as in many other aspects of medical practice. There is a common perception that BP-lowering is reno- protective. This concept is likely true if SBP is lowered from >160 mm Hg to <140 mm Hg. There were 3 medium-sized trials th
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	to <140 mm Hg. There were 3 medium-sized trials that enrolled exclusively CKD patients and compared ahigher versus a lower target BP level with kidney outcomes asprimary outcomes: the Modi ﬁcation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) trial, 9the African American Study of Kidney Dis- ease and Hypertension (AASK),10and the Blood-Pressure Control for Renoprotection in Patients with Non-diabeticChronic Renal Disease (REIN-2) trial, 11with few non- kidney events observed during the trial. A further caveat
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	events observed during the trial. A further caveat of MDRD and AASK is that both trials targeted mean arterial BP(MAP), rather than SBP or DBP . The lower target was a MAPof<92 mm Hg (equivalent to 125/75 mm Hg, 160/58 mm Hg, or many other combinations) and varied by age inMDRD. 12Whether lowering SBP from <140 mm Hg to <120 mm Hg is renoprotective is far from certain. Indeed, the long-term rate of decline of estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) in SPRINT was greater in the intensive SBP a
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	eGFR) in SPRINT was greater in the intensive SBP arm (<120 mm Hg) than in the standard SBP arm ( <140 mm Hg) in patients with CKD, although albuminuria during treatmentwas lower in the intensive SBP arm. 5Similar ﬁndings in eGFR differences were observed in the non-CKD subgroup inSPRINT, 13in ACCORD,14and in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes Trial (SPS3) trial.15Hence, the recommendation of target SBP <120 mm Hg is based not on renoprotective effects but on cardioprotective a
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	n renoprotective effects but on cardioprotective and survival beneﬁts. This is a clear distinction from the recommendation in the original KDIGO BP guideline. The 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline offers a target of <130/ <80 mm Hg for patients with CKD, which is more aggressive than that recommended by the European Society of Cardi-ology (ESC) and the European Society of Hypertension (ESH;SBP target 130 –139 mm Hg), and different from that recommended by the National Institute of Health and Care Excell
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	y the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE; SBP target 120 –139 mm Hg). 1,16–18 KDIGO recommends SBP <120 mm Hg, as measured us- ing standardized of ﬁce BP, because the WG takes the view thatpatients should not be penalized for suboptimal clinical practice and that standardized BP must be used to guidetherapy. Hypertension Canada also recommends a SBP targetof<120 mm Hg, consistent with the present guideline. 19 Antihypertensive drugs. There is limited evidence on the use of sp
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	drugs. There is limited evidence on the use of speci ﬁc antihypertensive agents to treat high BP in CKD. Many people with CKD and BP who are at least 20mm Hg above the target will need combinations of 2 or moreantihypertensive drugs. Starting combination therapy in suchpeople is, therefore, suggested. There are, however, no ran-domized trials comparing different drug combinations inCKD, as there are no randomized trials on antihypertensive classes other than renin-angiotensin system inhibitors
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	es other than renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi), b-blockers, and calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) compared to placebo or to each other. Any antihypertensive treatmentalgorithm in CKD, therefore, beyond monotherapy, is basedon expert opinion, pathophysiologic or pharmacodynamicconsiderations, or extrapolation from ﬁndings in the general population or from surrogate outcomes. Figure 3 displays the algorithm for BP therapy used in SPRINT. 2 A recent network meta-analysis by Xie et al. , inc
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	A recent network meta-analysis by Xie et al. , including 119 randomized trials conducted in 64,768 patients with CKDwith or without diabetes and albuminuria, examined thebeneﬁts of treating with RASi compared to other active therapies or placebo for kidney and cardiovascular out-comes. 20Both angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) reducedthe risk of kidney failure and major cardiovascular events. However, ACEi, but not ARB, reduced the odds of

In those with CKD without diabetes and severely increased albuminuria, 3 moderate quality trials (REIN Stratum-1,GISEN [REIN Stratum-2], Angiotensin-Converting-EnzymeInhibition in Progressive Renal Insuf ﬁciency [AIPRI], and Hou et al.) suggest CV bene ﬁts of RASi versus placebo in addition to kidney bene ﬁts (Figure 4 21–24).

The mineralocorticoid re- ceptor antagonist ﬁnerenone was examined for kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in CKD with diabetes in a ran-domized trial. In the Finerenone in Reducing KidneyFailure and Disease Progression in Diabetic Kidney Disease(FIDELIO-DKD) study, ﬁnerenone showed kidney and cardiovascular protection with modest effects on SBP (2 –3 mm Hg lower) but a higher incidence of hyperkalemia.

The trial was published after theevidence review cutoff for the guideline but will be assessedin future updates. An important future research topic calls for randomized trials examining various BP targets in advanced CKD, CKDwith diabetes, and severely increased albuminuric CKD, withcardiovascular, cognitive, and survival outcomes.Chapter 4: Blood pressure man

There are no completed randomized trials in kidney transplant recipients that examined different BP tar- gets for clinically important outcomes such as graft survival, cardiovascular events, or mortality, to provide practice guid-ance. Therefore, in the present guideline document a de ﬁni- tive recommendation on a BP target in this population is notprovided. Instead, a practice po

This practice point is identical to the recommendation in the KDIGO 2012 BP guideline andis also consistent with the target of <130/80 mm Hg rec- ommended in the KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for the Care of Kidney Transplant Recipients. It is important toemphasize that, as noted in Chapters 1 and 3, the targets fortransplant recipients are contingent upon BP being measuredin a stand

Foremost is the exclusion of transplant recipients i
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	remost is the exclusion of transplant recipients inlarge randomized trials on BP targets, such as SPRINT, thatdemonstrated cardiovascular and survival bene ﬁts. Second is the concern about the higher, albeit modest, incidence of acute kidney injury and rate of loss in eGFR in the arm randomized to SBP <120 mm Hg, compared to the higher SBP arm in SPRINT. It is conceivable that the potential loss ofautoregulation of arteriolar blood ﬂow, and hence GFR, in the solitary denervated transplant kidney
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	GFR, in the solitary denervated transplant kidney may aggravate thisadverse effect of lower BP on the kidney, although this hy-pothesis has not been substantiated by clinical data. The WGnotes that kidney allograft survival was unequivocally the dominant priority for patients, caregivers and health pro- fessionals in the Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology — Kidney Transplantation (SONG-Tx) project. 28Hence, there is signiﬁcant hesitance to lower the SBP target to <120 mm Hg in the absence of f
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	r the SBP target to <120 mm Hg in the absence of further evidence to support its bene ﬁts.Choice of antihypertensive agents. Compared to BP targets, there are more randomized trials on antihypertensive agents inadult kidney transplant recipients. Based on results of these trials,the WG recommends that a dihydropyridine CCB or an ARB beused as the ﬁrst-line antihypertensive agent in this population (Figure 1 ). This recommendation relies heavily on the impor- tance of preventing graft loss to kid
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	n the impor- tance of preventing graft loss to kidney transplant recipients and clinicians. The evidence review, which included both hyperten- sive and normotensive patients, has found that, in randomizedtrials compared to placebo, the use of dihydropyridine CCBs orARBs caused a reduction in graft loss. There are no survival orcardiovascular bene ﬁts of these 2 classes of drugs. Nonetheless, this recommendation is rated 1C on the basis of their renopro-tective effects. The bene ﬁcial effects of
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	enopro-tective effects. The bene ﬁcial effects of ACEi appear to be less well established. Randomized trial evidence shows that this class of drug reduces BP and proteinuria in kidney transplant recipients, but it has no effects on all-cause mortality or graft loss. Separateanalysis of the randomized trial data on the 2 classes of CCBsshowed that the bene ﬁcial effects on graft survival were seen in the dihydropyridines but not the non-dihydropyridines. There are other considerations in the sele
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	idines. There are other considerations in the selection of antihy- pertensive agents in the kidney transplant recipients. Forexample, in kidney transplant recipients with proteinuria, ARBs should be considered ﬁrst, given the known anti- proteinuric effects of these medications. In contrast, in theearly post-transplant period, ARBs should be avoided untilkidney transplant function has stabilized, as their acutenegative effect on GFR can be confused with other causes ofgraft dysfunction such as r
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	ed with other causes ofgraft dysfunction such as rejection. Women trying to conceiveor who are pregnant should be treated with a CCB, which isgenerally safe during pregnancy and lactation, whereas ARBs are contraindicated under these conditions.

A single moderately sized randomizedtrial on BP targets, the Effect of Strict Blood Pressure Control and ACE Inhibition on the Progression of CKD in Pediatric Patients (ESCAPE) trial, forms the basis of the followingrecommendation. 29In this trial, intensi ﬁed BP control tar- geting a 24-hour ambulatory MAP at <50th percentile of normal children was compared to standard BP control tar-geting a MAP within the 50th –99th percentile. The results
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	MAP within the 50th –99th percentile. The results showed a probable bene ﬁt in slowing kidney disease pro- gression and no greater risk of adverse events, such as hy- potension or an acute decrease in GFR. This study in children was not powered for and did not demonstrate differences inmortality. Primarily based on the results of this trial, the WGrecommends that in children with CKD, 24-hour MAPmeasured using ABPM should be lowered to one that isat#50th percentile of normal children with corres
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	sat#50th percentile of normal children with corresponding age, sex, and height ( Figure 1 ). This recommendation is rated 2C. It is unclear if the renoprotective bene ﬁts of BP-lowering extend to subpopulations characterized by different causes of CKD, levels of albuminuria, races, and ethnicities. A keydifference between the current and prior KDIGO recom-mendations on BP management in children with CKD is thatthe prior KDIGO guideline made a recommendation for theinitiation of antihypertensive
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	ommendation for theinitiation of antihypertensive medication when the of ﬁce SBPor DBP is consistently above the 90th percentile for gender, age, and height, whereas in the current guideline, all children with CKD and 24-hour ABPM MAP consistently above the50th percentile should be treated.

In contrast to the adult CKD popula- tion that was included in SPRINT, there are no randomizedtrials in the pediatric CKD population targeting standardizedofﬁce BP with meaningful clinical out
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	standardizedofﬁce BP with meaningful clinical outcomes. ABPM is, however, burdensome and resource-intensive. Therefore, a practice point has been added that ABPM should be per- formed annually, supplemented by standardized auscultatoryofﬁce BP every 3 –6 months in children with CKD. Proper preparations and techniques are essential for of ﬁce BP mea- surement in children, similar to those described in Chapter 1for adults, with the exception that auscultatory BP is preferredover automated oscillo
KDIGO_BP_Exec_Summary_final.pdf	auscultatory BP is preferredover automated oscillometric BP, since normative BP data inchildren were derived using the former technique. ABPM may not be available at all in most clinics. There are also young children who will not tolerate ABPM. In thosecircumstances, manual of ﬁce-based auscultatory or oscillo- metric BP measurement obtained in a standardized manner,targeting achieved SBP at <90th percentile for age, sex, and height of normal children, is a reasonable approach.Appendix Table 1 |

It is further suggested as a practice point that an ACEi or ARB be used as ﬁrst-line therapy for high BP in children with CKD. These drugslower proteinuria and are usually well-tolerated, although theliterature in children is not as vast as that in adult CKDpatients. An important recommendation for future re

Conclusions Our current guideline, updated from the 2012 version, strongly emphasizes the use of standardized measurement of BP and recommends a SBP target of <120 mm Hg in most subpopulations of people with CKD, contingent upon thistechnique. More large randomized trials on BP targets,powered for cardiovascular, kidney, cognitive, a

The relationship  between routine of/f_ice BP and standardized of/f_ice BP is highly variable; therefore, it  is not possible to apply a correction factor to translate a given routine BP value to a

HBPM may be particularly important for the management of BP when a  clinic visit is not practical, for example, during the coronavirus disease 2019  (COVID-19) pandemic. However, at present, HBPM should only be used to  complement standardized of/f_ice measurement and not guide treatment  decisions, if standardized of/f_ice BP is available. Adults with high BP and CKD should be treated to a target SBP <120 mm Hg  which must
Top-10-Takeaways-Clinicians-KDIGO-BP-Guideline.pdf	be treated to a target SBP <120 mm Hg  which must be measured using standardized of/f_ice BP preparations and  techniques. When measured under standardized conditions, targeting SBP  <120 mm Hg reduces the risks of CV events and all-cause mortality in CKD;  however, the effects on progression of kidney disease are uncertain. The SBP target of <120 mm Hg also applies to the subgroups of older  adults and those with increased albuminuria. The balance of bene/f_its  and harms is less certain in pe

The bene/f_its of intensive BP lowering are less certain among patients  with concomitant CKD and diabetes, compared to patients with CKD  without diabetes. RASi (ACEi or ARB) should be used in patients with CKD and increased  albuminuria, with or without diabetes. The evidence for use of RASi in  patients with moderately increased albuminuria is lower in quality than  in s

Low sodium intake (<2 g/day) and moderate-intensity physical activity (≥150 min/week) are suggested in accordance with recommendations for  the general population. For adult kidney transplant recipients, a target of <130/<80 mm Hg, using  standardized of/f_ice measurement, is still a reasonable goal. A lower SBP  goal (<120 mm Hg) for kidney transplant recipients would require  additional data on the risks and bene/
